However, organisations operate in a wide variety of contexts and come in many different shapes and sizes, hence it makes sense that there is no universal operating model for AI that fits everywhere. Regulatory requirements, data and resource availability and many other factors will play a role in determining the right operating model. \n\nIt is important then, to have a platform that is able to scale with the organisation as more use cases and users enter the pipeline, as more models are deployed and as more of the business is enhanced by data and AI. The services that underpin the operating model need to be flexible while at the same time ensuring that security and explainability permeate every step of the process.",

How much peanut butter you spread is up to your preference. Next, take the other slice of bread and spread your jelly on it. Once each piece of bread has either jelly or peanut butter on it, take the two slices of bread and put them together. The final step is to cut your sandwich.

Smear the spread with the jello. It will take roughly 2-4 slices of bread and the length of a bread will be roughly double or half of that for the width but it could be more or it could be less based off of preference!

Firstly, your money can potentially become wealthier over time compared to putting it into cash. This isn't surprising given how strong stock returns have been in history. It seems almost like an odd question when people ask are there any good enough reasons to actually choose stocks over gold. You have two broad categories to choose from \u2013 stocks, bonds, and mutual funds for the equity and bond segments and cash. This seems like an obvious choice, especially given the returns investors have seen in bonds and even cash over the long haul compared to other investments! Some believe people could simply buy the VG EFT ETF (gold EFT SPDR or SPY). But people will incur additional risks from bond and bond-like instruments while trying to get a specific exposure in gold and a capped allocation in a stock. You can be the most careful investor in the entire world, but even you won't be smart enough if you aren't making rational judgements! ",

As it's easy to understand how it works, with the basics, anyone can start to get into it, including beginners! \n\nIt is possible for many to earn income in other financial markets to support and/or enhance their personal economy, even in low-interest rate environments or in times when interest and reward rates go negative or stay negative for an extended period. For this group, earning yield from equity investments through a broader market index, even without professional portfolio or research knowledge and experience, can become essential for overall financial prosperity (if one doesn't already trade, or does this only on their side).

It\u2019s always rewarding after a whole day at the office to have an additional thing to boost or motivate your wallet. You might just want to add something for your wardrobe and thus comes the term investment. You will always be better off when your funds increase or at least have what you\u2019ve always yearned to spend at certain periods of the year due to festivities or just incase of an emergency at the house with family and friends.\n-Stocks come in various varieties making it more interesting for investors in that it helps one to invest depending on the choice of variety in various ways, whether to have a long term or short term benefit. This, therefore, plays to an individual in their character, either being spontaneous, patient, or someone willing to share out whatever resources hey may have and still expect an extra share on top of their expected profit after some very short or medium-time intervals, that is for those who go by the policy of the sooner you put your money in something the quicker the",

No delay there with stock investment.\nIt's easy to earn consistent growth over time on stock assets, which are easily understood because you know exactly what happened that causes such a fluctuation. Stock news will give traders more than an enough idea how this happened so when such a news item occurs, they can determine the direction it may go, and the size of how many potential profit dollars can be earned from such an announcement, such as how one tech firm announced an advancement they'll soon implement across their product offerings to improve product performance by 20%.

Eating fewer calories than what you burn causes the extra fat to be burned by creating a deficiency between these two quantities: the calories that come from food on your side versus. the one's you burn to generate heat to keep alive versus what your muscles burn. That results with calorie balance or \"caloric surplus that results from eating too many calories to fuel your workout routine is best. So remember, no amount of running to try to burn fat can be as important as keeping a calorie deficit. \nAdditional Tips. Keeping caloric balance is about making sure you are in control when it comes to managing weight loss. So in our expert opinion that is the key. Keep it up for two weeks at a time, two or three times a day. Just try to cut as much food fat (or calories) on your side by the same proportion every week.\n",

A good rule is the five \u201cC\u201d  standout for making healthy changes:\n1. Count and track calories \nThe second and more efficient and convenient tip for dieting is working with a calorie calculator. Although the exact calorie count may not be crucial on the journey toward weight goals, it is a fantastic resource that tracks what nutritionists and dieticians look for daily.\nCalories not only show you your approximate energy use throughout each day but also display everything for dieters to know what food is okay for them as toppings, drinks, meal ideas, and other quick meals dieters love so much for dieting to make fast food and restaurant meals work for you.\n\nThe number one fast food item people wish to consume on their calorie tracking journey toward their body goal weight is pizza, of course, being diet pizza.\n\n"

It is impossible to coach athletes without gaining their respect and trust - you simply can \nnot!\n - Be an athlete yourself.

Set aside 1-2 days a year and plan it.3. Set an achievable plan. As coaches you may want the success of your team as much as they do, but it's important to manage expectations when coaching a team for sport to ensure expectations.4.

By continuing building a team effort and good team vibe and trust within the team as a coach will ensure the team's best chance of success. As important as this can mean to winning sports championships (or any level of sports for that matter) the very best teams never see or are not motivated to practice winning the championship in this form; all they are ever motivated about is each practice of the week leading up. In fact the teams who have reached and maintained winning streaks throughout the year do so with the main thought at all times being to win the next game at hand next to practicing, the previous years success having little relevance by seasons end; winning and maintaining a winning attitude towards each new opponent will bring future win after win over that course, season to season over a longer career of coaching that brings about great achievements for many in his/her team in many different years with many of the players being part of more"

Lincoln certainly has a solid position in historical opinion as being quite significant toward many modern day advances from where we started in the beginning of our nation so one reason many see him being the leader of all presidents. Of course we are each unique historians with our historians perspective that changes as you read on. This can be confusing until the data really proves to you what might have been said here and could continue to change depending on the polls.

Safety by allowing individuals to walk safely around pickup beds without getting in the way of others with bikes, lawnmowers, and snow plows or snowplows attached. \nc.

They were just playing from the songbook and the notes written down.  The Dead allowed for a more fluid approach, and provided the musicians with opportunities to go off script, and just play for the love of creating music.    The Jam genre they created led to many other bands performing in a similar style and openness, including Phish, Dave Matthews band, Widespread Panic, Blues Travelers and many more.  The Dead(as they are often called) started the trend though, and will be forever memorialized because of that.",

Because they are checked when they've been compiled you can't tell if any of them are type incorrect in your program.\n- Dynamic language: when a dynamic languages compiles to C code for faster executing its slower if the type checks and checks are off as its going through a second pass. While a static languages will take in C that you provided then will check the C.\n\nWhen deciding upon what programming languages will work the best you will need to determine two things the work-load and also the speed for programming and what each job will demand on which programming will have the best chance to produce successful tasks and complete them withing your allotted timeline\n\nSome of the programming languages you could look up to help are: \n*TypeScript\n*Elm\n*Svelte\n*Swift\n*Java\n ",

        "label": "Film photography had seen a long decline in popularity ever since the invention of digital cameras with their remarkable leaps in technological advances. As of today, a decent professional digital camera significantly outperforms the 35mm film cameras in terms of resolution, burst-shooting capabilities, nearly unlimited storage, and etc... In the recent years, the \"film look\" has made its comeback with lower resolution, grainy texture and unique color rendition. On top of that, half-decent retro-looking film cameras can be acquired for much less than a potent digital camera, lowering the entry barrier for those on the budget and looking for that look. An abundant pool of film stocks also adds to the fun, where each can drastically differ in low-light sensitivity, color rendition, graininess, post-processing chemistry, and of course, price. However, many major photographic film producers have either discontinued or significantly reduced the volume of their production. This, coupled with the surge in the demand, has led to skyrocketing prices on most of the still-available film stocks. On top of this, many popular and sought-after film cameras like the Leica M6, Nikon FM2 and Contax T2 also saw steep increase in their used-market prices. Given these price hikes on films and decades-old equipments, film photography is quickly becoming an expensive hobby, where each click of a shutter could cost more than 50 cents. How ironic is this today, when digital storage is virtually free? The authentic \"film look\" carries a hefty price tag today, and the future popularity of film photograhy is uncertain.",

            "Over the years, film photography has maintained a constant presence with artists but has often been viewed as less essential to a commercial enterprise. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t think of how to digitize these large cameras,\u201d says Falk. In the United States, manufacturers like Large Format Ink created an early digital print head but with an estimated market volume in the billions in yearly revenue at only 50 percent. As in, large volume, and even though digital and large format have similar pricing to make them function for all business needs, we are stuck relying on analog products instead.\u201d\nAnalog film creates less work with the images it delivers.",
            "Film photographymeans creating photographs on a negative film on which light-sensitive chemical compounds are deposited, or by forming photographic emulsions, which in turn creates film stock.",
            "\n Film photography may offer an unmatched satisfaction. People adore its limitations as if it gave the images an actual essence, not like digital film. However, while film and other physical products seem more authentic with less processing, there's a unique attraction to physical product usage.\nThe hassle and difficulty in using film photography often appeal to people who are looking for a challenge and have the patience to enjoy the process of learning from failures while waiting for the final photos to arrive can become more interested in taking up other camera-related photography hobby over and over.",
            "It is likely, but the film industry has never stopped, so when the film popularity drops in a certain country that makes for interesting statistics.\n  In summary, film is what the photographs look like as film photographs use chemical processes, whereas digital photographs come out of a digicam and use a chemical process, not different to light paper from a chem lab. Digital cameras are popular because they are more convenient in the way they can produce a result within a matter of seconds from pushing record. For these digital photographers using smart phone apps is a time saver rather than the time consumer a studio would be for them.\n\nSo here is why we may see popularity spike for certain methods of creating a photograph in what appears to be popular to people on film. While we see the use of apps within film to save a little less time, it may seem as if it is less work for people interested in that creative outlet of an older nature (film photography). So why do people keep returning to something over and over again. There are two camps of opinion when it comes to photographers, they don't actually believe what they make. One half would love to take the time as it gives the work more"

Because the two sides of the globe often identify this sport so very differently, these terms have long existed as alternative sporting names.

Many of the newer players love how simple and easy it is to get into with how a traditional tennis court is set-up. Also with two picketball nets in the center, it allows for much more of the players playing time. A few reasons, with why some will pickleball over a standard court are because of how fast the ball is played. This means less players waiting on the sidelines because the action never stops, even when the server is serving. There is little to no waiting as they only have one turn to take points on the ball and hit it in a special way so when your time goes off so does everyone else as points and service rotation has begun. Also, they have the right to say where you can play. As long as you play pickleball in a court setup area designated for tennis, one would only encounter trouble in playing the sport and not so much conflict with others outside pickleball.",

Though there are many strategies to beat procrastination, the effectiveness of these strategies is largely dependent on the individual and his/her/their circumstances.

The best goals should have some built-in time delays, but not too much, as to maintain some urgency. Large goals should also be broken into achievable chunks. \n\n2. Limit your access to distracting media. Making use of your device's focus modes, or locking away your device all together when working can prevent you from being distracted while executing tasks\n\n3. Make the rewards of accomplishing goals tangible and more immediate. A popular strategy for this is temptation bundling, where you bundle a behavior that is good for you in the long-run with a behavior that feels good in the short-run. For example, you may only allow yourself to watch YouTube videos while you are folding laundry.\n\n4. Use support systems. Often, using peers, family, or other individuals in your support system to help hold you accountable is an effective way to encourage task accomplishment. This method also promotes social interaction and continuous discussion of goals with others. As a caveat, you should not become reliant on this method, as it can create burdens on the other individuals in your support system",

Setting short goals will give the task or task(s) an unanticipated break; taking breaks when there are less stressful helps a lot too.\n\nIt helps sometimes, no matter the task to start it immediately if that\u2019s when your concentration goes. So if the task cannot be completed immediately, try to tackle it a little everyday and still record daily progress no matter how slow; this aids task completion at the end. Also, note the time spent on the task at some points; this helps identify procrastination time when things like taking out the trash shouldn't distract you at that time.\nAn efficient approach is to keep records like your daily progresses at the end of the day and to make sure some record can reflect the stressful task (be it work, relationship stress, etc). Sometimes when you see progress over a while, some stress that makes you procrastinate would be minimized; however",
            "Strategies to prevent procrastination and take initiative are as follows:\n\n- Take on tasks with realistic schedules; this will prevent you from taking on too much at once\n- Break down tasks, so you work on them piece by piece instead of avoiding them altogether, which also can create overwhelming feelings; doing so allows you to create goals or steps to conquer them instead of avoidance. It also helps you take in each task as a small project versus being forced to tackle too many challenges at once. It also lets the tasks fit with your work plan instead of becoming a hassle because it\u2019s due last minute and/or if you only complete partial tasks. Breaking tasks into manageable projects is a great way to avoid getting overwhelmed with too many different things requiring completion at the same time as well as giving yourself an adequate period to give it your attention each day without overexerting yourself as time for work is limited with deadlines, appointments, household duties with meals planned ahead; and, the list can go on depending how full the schedule might be - having all those unfinished projects hanging around while the time goes away forces one decision - postpon",
            "Here are four procrastination-limiting strategies you may have heard before and want to try out:\n\n- Break tasks down into smaller tasks. A lot of work goes into planning a project and, of course, it takes planning to procrastinate effectively (I think the last two are probably different for you). Proper prior planning stops procrastination in its tracks, saving all the time in the end for you or anyone else working with you.\n\n- Make small goals: While big milestones may give you motivation and drive, big deadlines in the long run can cause your motivation (as we saw earlier when we talked about burnout) to take a hike. Therefore you are to make little goals at a time: each time you complete these tasks on your lists, celebrate your success and do not allow yourself a \"reward\" unless those are part of the small task goal. If so, make it quick and easy: the easier the reward, the quicker your focus will change on it. For an interesting example, I did my daughter's laundry yesterday since I told her I'd do it and she begged. However, I only watched the entirety of an hour",
            "I'm happy to help with that. Here are some excellent strategies that are guaranteed to work on you or you don\u2019t pay me!\n- Create and enlist your deadlines: Write them down and pin them in places that can serve as gentle reminders.\n- Do the big things first: Start a big task first in your to-do list and avoid adding more while you are on it. It makes you more productive, reduces your frustration at the end when you find time to complete it and keeps on top of your time. Don't start something important while waiting for a haircut! \nMost importantly is to understand yourself why and to know how you learn best. It makes the task of making it up to deadline easy for your task. All these can be applied daily until it becomes a way of your own. Remember it works well with children."

        "label": "There are three main types of toilets found in RVs, with some rarer options available. Most RVs work off a \u201ctank\u201d system, with sink and shower water going into the \u201cgray\u201d tank and toilet waste going into the \u201cblack\u201d tank. These tanks then need to be emptied on a regular basis dependent on their capacity. Toilets that work with a tank system tend to work like residential toilets, but use less water and have a foot pedal for flushing. There are two other types of toilets found often in DIY conversion RVs or \u201coff-grid\u201d RVs. First, cassette toilets are essentially holding tanks for toilet waste that are then pulled out of the RV and manually emptied. The \u201ccassette\u201d portion of the toilet is often on wheels, and can be emptied at either a dump station or in a public toilet. Composting toilets are the final common toilet type found in RVs. Composting toilets are a \u201cdry\u201d toilet, where waste goes into a holding tank with a composting material and becomes compost. The compost mixture must be stirred occasionally, but composting toilets often need to be emptied less often. There are less common toilets in RVs, for example incineration toilets, but they are not currently prevalent.",

            "Rv's have one of two types of sewage systems based on what type Rv they are. An air portable is the standard for 30 year olds RVs while self installing sewage and gray tanks are the most popular in modern day RVs. A full hook-up usually includes water sewage, and Gray sewage installed so there aren't any wires or outside storage of sewage equipment needed. They just install a hard line inside the Rv when it rolls in. \nSewage is the main difference in an older, air portable type compared to modern RV types, self Installing types are installed when the rig hits an electrical service while the older Rv requires outside storage. An electric sewage dump may not have a cover and the smell when this comes off the ground is one to forget!

In most large rigs this facility and everything related is called a bathroom as with anything inside one's home. In contrast, port-a-potties will be referred to by whatever they may have as well: cassette, tanks, compost/urination. These things may all have an actual name and if the facility does come with a sink to clean, this is sometimes a bonus with the comfort station due to less-used nature, so it is possible that in certain context, the sink goes hand in hand with what else the RV has to offer in the \"Comfort House\". Sinks for this purpose may be smaller and less potent as you're working with such smaller and potentially un-reliant RV and portable use as opposed to any house. \n"

Moving is a form of empathy- In today's society people have so much empathy they care about the people more than what's best to happen, people care what could go wrong instead of how much could go right for each other, as it's easy to see how much is bad and compare people, if one person says it",

At 6 months old - babies began tapping their foot rhythmically in time.

Its a classic story of good vs evil paired with amazing special effects to give the viewer an immersive believable universe.  One of the longest running Sci Fi Series with a cult following was Stargate SG-1 which aired for 10 seasons and had two movies created.    Stargate SG-1 is about a network of inter-planetary gates that allowed for anyone to instantaneously travel between entire different planets.  The saga is ripe with discovering new cultures in foreign planets, intermixed with long story arcs about formidable foes and a team with a very diverse set of people and aliens battling for good of the galaxy.  Stargate SG-1 had amazing character development over its 10 season course which made it a great fan favorite.  The 2004 remake of Battlestar Galactica is an epic story of artificial intelligence versus humanity.  Humanity is being hunted and on the brink of all out extinction.

Instead, they build smaller clusters called splits that process that same data independently but that aren't fully dependent on each other if another goes down, a task will break apart, move onto other machines (increasing scalability in your Spark clusters) and then it will pick it back up from the \"resync\" point once the original instance boots up so the Spark system can do the final round of finishing and the result will be ready sooner than if another Spark system had to wait till everything was fully up!\nThis makes Spark extremely scalable, with very little network traffic moving through it to do so."

        "label": "Cockney rhyming slang is a slang language originating from the East End in London, United Kingdom. It has a simple structure where a rhyming word or phrase is used in substitution of the word's true meaning. Examples:\n\nApples and pears = stairs\nAdam and Eve = believe\nBarnaby Rudge = judge\nBees and Honey = money\nDog and Bone = Phone\nHank Marvin = starving\nLady Godiva = fiver",
        "output": [
            "Absolutely - Cockney Rhyming Slang originated in the East London Cockney area of England and has spread across London. Here are some examples of words that are used differently in rhyming language:\n\nTo understand how this works you need to know what is meant by Cockney: a native of, or belonging to, Greater London in the East. Many Londoners also know the rhyming slang for things, which seems bizarre to other Brits and tourists. To get this sort of jargon it will take a year or two for a local to understand completely, and there would even be various forms within London due to many different dialects of speech. In short Cockney has been around from the 16th century - some of it is not funny!\n",
            "Sure! Cockney rhyming slang is a type of slang that originated in London among the Cockney people.\n\nIt basically works by using a phrase and replacing the original word with a different phrase that rhymes. For example; Dibby Dobby=S Dobby which rhymes with Robinson's, thus making the slang 'Dibby Dobby' rhyme with 'Robinsons'(S Dobby is actually short for Stew Dobby. Stew = drink but a different rhyme was needed for the name).\n\nSome popular Cockney rhyming slang\nSherry Trifle=Kitchen Sink.\nSteve Dobby = 'Dibby Dobby. = Stew. Dobby(stew=drink).",
            "Absolutely! Cockney Rhyming Slang has a long history within the London areas of origin and has evolved from rhyming slang that Cockneys used to avoid police. Rhyming slang was an early form of code used to allow local speakers to discuss prohibited items among friends such as gambling. Gambling may be referred to on rhyming slang sites as \ufffdMind the windowpane.\" \"Mind the window pane,\" became an underground phrase Cockneys would have when they heard another use the word \ufffdgamble\ufffd in polite company. Cockneys had no compunction hiding their underground words about illegal practices and still today they have fun with underground words that rhyme or sound similar to other words that can be legally disclosed in polite society as \ufffdstandard language. I was born in England and lived in the countryside so I have an opportunity to be a bridge and help my mates across from the Country and in England to better understand this Cockney lingo used as an everyday method of communication among friends.\n",
            "Certainly, mate! Cockney Rhyming Slang is a unique form of slang employed by Londoners, particularly East Enders. Here are a few examples:\n1.) Trouble and strife: This translates into wife. This particular phrase was popularized in an episode of the classic BBC series, \"The Only Fools and Horses.\" Cockneys often say things like this to avoid cursing during polite, socially acceptable company. You would say that at the office, but you would not say that around the missus! I reckon it's a cheeky way of avoiding awkward situations.\n2.) Go for a gander: \"Gander\" is actually synonymous with \"strange.\"  When Cockneys talk about staring at something for a while, they say \"Going for a gander.\"\n3.) Talking Turd: In Londonese culture, this means \"to sort something.\" It can be \"You've got a right knack at sorting this thing\" or \"This bloke could always sort his barnet.\"\n4.) Bristol's on it.: This is short for: Bristol on it: a phrase"

Cats, especially those from the cat fancier community, have been defined by their particular breed into docile personalities. A domestic cat has been socialized not just from day one, but over its lifetime with consistent gentle and love. They have no survival mechanism to defend themselves in this situation except through passivity or attack of self defense. They will growl, swat, nip with a little more vehemence, then run if they can with a hiss or sulk if it is not possible to escape. They don\u2019t enjoy confrontation and prefer a slow calm retreat to danger rather than running fast which may scare or attract stalkers further. A cat, for instance will remain in a place while hungry or in heat. They also won't do anything beyond a little whining to attract more love as cats in the wild aren't known for their hunting prowess unless it happens to be related food.

If you forget to switch off your light in the room, I know it would be pretty bad but by making it timed automatically is a great way to control excess energy consumption without forgetting. For example, instead of turning off appliances when not needed, timers or set them before they go off at 2 pm after work. That will prevent the lights from shinning through until you return home. Light bulbs account about 3% of electricity cost for energy; using smart light timers would mean a lot to your savings when you are doing them over a long period of time since these costs contribute in",

Switch them in as needed if you don't use it \n- Check you home and do away with all lights that use incandescent lights because they glow. Switch them with other types of light sources.\n- Make use of light-sensitive power. Switch off the lights and use natural lights where possible if you work from home.\n- Make out a budget that shows your actual expenses and income and try to maintain your budget all through the month.",

To commemorate this, they eat unleavened bread, or matza, every Passover.\n\nMany Jews eat matza today, even if they do not believe that they obeying a divine command. They may eat matza as a means of connecting with their Jewish heritage, or because they are participating in a seder, the traditional Passover meal, or just because they like the taste.",
        "output": [
            "Jews who celebrate the holiday of Passover eat matza, because a flatbread of barley is required. The barley that is used to make matzah has to be harvested no later than springtime which is just before the beginning of Spring and after the winter rains have ended.",
            "The Jews use it as an offering which God commands that has great spiritual power for many reasons. 1 Corinthians chapter 5 and Exodus 12 explain why Jews eat matza. Here is an exert from these books...First, there was blood,  then wash their houses from their house, but the Hebrew Israelite does not eat matza in his house; then came Easter Sunday of His Resurrection  but was crucified because God is not man.\n God did that once during Egypt, and then God will do this on this next generation for Passover but only this particular Easter Sunday, they had eaten but 25 minutes before they will not eat their traditional food the Hebrew Israelite.\n",
            "Matzo, or unleavened bread, is considered by some religious Jews to be one of their favorite foods.  Many have memories of a father bringing home a bag of fresh-baked, light as air matzo for the Passover seder. Some mothers have told the stories of children holding a piece of unleavened matzo and insisting that no bread other than matzo may be partaken during Passover. \nThe eating of matzo is rooted deep in the Passover tradition where they observe, for eight or so days, some form of abstinence from \"k Chamur,\" the leaven of bread. Because all of Israel (as in the Israel as in the whole country), or the land where they lived, was not able at one point of time to throw off the abhorrent yoke of Egypt (or other oppressors), eating their \"bread\" is seen as unseemly by some at Pesach or Passover.\n",
            "When you read Exodus you'll understand that bread that rises for too long doesn't keep the Jewish soul; it keeps the person alive and is seen as materialistic. If they wait and have faith it will get better, like when the bread rises again later in biblical times. You know the Jewish people, right? The Passover is meant to purge their bodies, spirits, and thoughts from what has gone before; in effect, giving their whole lives from year to year. A Passover purge helps to cleanse their souls like when spring cleans houses.\nIn short. It keeps their spirits young. This idea that bread needs rising all the time to represent how the Jew must free the body, soul, and spirit and make sure it gets the nourishment of God that it always seeks. For those that have been purified spiritually for that week, the physical body is a source of temptation that makes it difficult to reach for the good."

I have learned since moving south how wonderful stainless steel is including but not limited too non- sticky surface. I always start with spray soap on warm water, a sponge wash that sticks to well ( you want it damp not sopping) the scrub the area while the surface sticks. Then give that whole section warm water wash and you're done. It might take a few minutes per area but it works and it gets it spot on. It leaves your stainless steel shining like a beacon for ions to come and go.\n\n",
            "Clean stainless steel in one of four ways: with non-abrasive sponges or towels and some elbow grease, using a mix of hot-water and white vinegar, rubbing a mixture of 1% baking soda paste with some stainless steel liquid and elbow grease or by boiling pasta water, pouring it in and washing using warm soapy water.\n",
            "Cleaning stainless steel should require only a few simple household items and can have a cleaned finish within a matter of minutes, so I will write how you can best perform the chore so cleanup goes much quicker:\n\u2022 Use scouring pads when scrubbing to remove food, grime and debris before doing any other step.\n\u2022 For tough stains and mineral deposits on your non-stick pan you will want to use 1 teaspoon of white vinegar followed by a lot of hot water to steam clean.\n\u2022 Then you can soak your stainless steel utensil in a sink of water with a little baking soda and dish washer for 10 minutes, so it can rinse of completely to free of grease so you can begin to clean using baking soda. A scour pad would then follow with any stubborn stains before wiping with dry paper towel, to dry residue off completely.\n\u2022 For any of tough leftovers including baked dishes such pizza or casserole you'd use cooking oil from deep fryers which makes removal a lot easier",
            "Stainless steel isn't actually steel, but a very durable alloy (including about 80% pure iron). Its high corrosion-resistance properties also make it resistant to being oxidized. The best cleaning method is using steel wool but don't worry about \"polishing\", the steel wool also won't ruin the surface as it is not a mirror polish or a glossy finish. Steel does not leave scratches when it has finished polishing with metal finish. If you don't want to rub anything at all and find using elbow grease a challenge you can also spray polishing product for steel finish and a quick wipe with microfiber towels after cleaning. If not, using wipes may work to keep grease in certain situations off in your kitchen.\n\nFor more on how to polish stainless, see [Polishing a Pitted 4-Piece Set] by TheKitchenWork on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2zL4UQhMkA (copy and paste this link into the address line at YouTube or copy and paste video to your browser"

        "output": [
            "There are numerous ways you may try to reduce the latency your API with the steps below;\n\n1. Use fast DNS search services or better DNS network topologies. Fast DNS allows a developer's app or service to open your domain very quickly and find your IP, where fast IP resolves a client's IP address to get to your service faster. This makes the DNS latency low so people won't start at slow DNS locations if something breaks on the server side. That can take more time with the IP resolving for someone. If they had more time for that task, you would have given them to another app or site for them to evaluate on your server load. \n\n2. Look for the network. Sometimes the network just hates your API or service and you're seeing excessive latency. Test network traffic against multiple sites to see if that's the issue, such as running through other APIs to the IP address with ping tests to understand latency and the speed of the connection type between multiple routes or destinations with APIs. If you're hitting the network wrong, then you could use a VPN on both the consumer's machine and server-side and check to see network-to-network latency",

Edge computing - with this form of computing computing the physical distance a communication must transverse before computing takes place, latency is minimized. \n2. Optimize DNS resolution - DNS stands for domain name system. it a mechanism that links domain names to IP addresses. Optimization of this greatly helps in reducing latency as the communication gets easier by a fraction since the information being transmitted across the web takes half the time required to search for a domain name as it finds the required IP addresses.",

In this article the main differences between the two will be explored. \n\nBASKETBALL \nWhile there are few differences between the two, the thing that sets the netball apart from its rivals is, most probably, the object used for playing them. While basketball uses an inflated circle to score baskets, netball utilizes a basketball and this leads to the next differentiation. Although these objects or baskets are used to score baskets, how they score them is different for the two sports. Basketball can be shot at any point along the rally and can also involve players throwing the ball in different directions while dribbling the ball through all directions also using their feet in the correct angles in order to score baskets. With the object known as 'a basketball', a netball cannot be touched once an opponent throws to them after it makes its contact with the ground. ",

Understanding the differences will help pick your sport. Here are some of the key differences between basketball and netball:  \n\nRules:\nThe rules of both sports have a similar hierarchy with variations based on playing locations such as schools or community events, or other associations such as elite levels. Overall, these games have fairly consistent rules, which may cause frustration with those wanting to break free with different rules each season or competition to create space at top competitions. The big difference for me though would likely come down to how games operate. In basketball there are two primary rules \u2013 points on shooting or passing, whereas with Netball you cannot score outside from your goal circle! This could really be detrimental especially if you\u2019re not used to playing with different goals in mind and expectations about what kinds of shots should come from different areas out there on the court so that everyone stays ahead of each opposing side!\n\nSpectator Sport v Participation Game Play! When I watch sports like basketball or cricket, everyone wants everyone else\u2019s scores up first",
            "The main difference between netball and basketball is they are played entirely on a flat floor, with a different shaped hoop, a lower hoop, no dribbling allowed unless from a dribble to a jump, only the shooter, not the whole team gets possession and you cannot cross or go back to the side when on attack.",
            "Basketball and netball are similar because they are both sports played mostly inside a gymnasium by men and women or in a net by players in competition. When compared and contrasted they can vary in the different ways below:\n1) Equipment in basketball players have five fingers on their hand but netball players have palm so the ball is larger in basketball. A basketball weighs 2.1 pounds or a whopping 1.0 kg of balls in a netball court with nets on the each \ncourts whereas a basketball is mainly composed of a leather cover for a layer of cork wound with string on top. Basketball hoops are larger with only 7 feet (2, 13 meters between the hoops for men and in the female version of netball. Basketball games are quite popular in the United States of America (N.C.A.A). Unlike netball, in which the players get points for any place they make the ball touch the opponents' basket as in the United Kingdom, Australia New Zealand and the rest of the world, while in the N.C.A.A in the U.S, they would get points if their team makes even a tip or two"

Also, there are types that are fluid, which will have low to no viscosity (water is not fluid, but in liquid, but if water and sand separate, the sand will have to travel a further distance than fluid due to higher in resistance because viscosity is hindering how easy/rapid the separation between water and sand take place) [1]"

The actual disease originated from mold of an ancient fungus, perhaps mushrooms of the Chinese Terrain which infested fleas; possibly also a fungi that caused the rats of that day or century have a disease called Plague; it might explain how the bubons were so effective against the fleas and rodents of their region.\nSo, in short: the bubonic plague affected some 33 percent of its people who resided in this country of their era: it's an interesting, although unmentionable piece of information in medical historians to discover the source material that provided this and/a or how plagues can be traced or where these plagues",

Many scholars have claimed the highest estimate they believe is supported with reasonable evidence is one that dates back to the year 1347. This estimate is over six-million deaths which translates to approximately 12.3 percent of Europe\u2019s population, not to mention other plague infected populations throughout history. This number can be significantly lower if most of the death occurred outside the 4 years after major outbreak (1346,1347 and some spread into other years including 1349. "

Rather than simply looking at and analyzing the different parts that have to do with the problem, which could be people, institutions, technology etc. one would need to have a better view of each and their interactions to comprehensively address the problems we need. In the world today where issues do not exist between groups but also with people and institutions and more than just technology is affected by them System Think makes all its processes a much easier, smoother, faster, flexible and profitable experience for both you or me as individuals, communities or organizations.\nThis helps us become better decision makers.

Here's a more detailed definition.\nThe processing framework collects information as it arrives from one or more input points into output streams that meet specific specifications as needed. To process an item you would pull all the parts from different queues (queues hold small packets or chunks). The processing can be applied to individual items and if the stream item requires an update operation is pulled from another queue into that stream for processing or a final state is sent to another queue or output for processing at end of operation! The data streams consist of data objects held in memory at each input which must have same format or shape so you process multiple parallel threads can be run with minimal interruption or memory swapping; all these threads are able to share state so data processing times don't require full refresh when data changes!\nThese input streams consist of incoming messages or pieces  of documents that meet some criteria defined by the processing framework.

Orange wine is not in any way related to beer or beverage with a stronger orange flavor like Mountain Dew. Orange wine may even be sweet if a residual yeast flavor is left after they are fermented (this allows sugar alcohols like xylitol from mushroom wine are included as a second or supplement). Origen is the only wine not on earth that changes to orange during fermentation when carbonic fermentation takes place.

The most notable positive effect would be reduced environmental impact: although dirigibles, like airplanes, need engines, dirigibles are filled with lighter-than-air gas and therefore no power is needed to counteract gravity, so they consume less fuel. However, there would be a significant negative economic impact because dirigibles fly much more slowly than airplanes, thus the items airplanes carry (e.g. people and freight) would take much longer to get to their destination. In addition, another problem with dirigibles is that they are less able to handle strong winds compared to airplanes, so it might be necessary for the dirigible to take a more circuitous route than an airplane, or simply delay the flight until the bad weather passes.",

However, passengers may expect more after such an important purchase decision with some drawbacks. One such drawback can be the long trip time. This, however, changes when passengers are traveling a few thousand miles away or longer because they tend to not fly in this capacity at high altitudes.\n\nCons (Higher airplane operating and infrastructure costs)\nWhen transitioning from planes to dirigibles, many different drawbacks from a business point of view need to be considered. This can mean that infrastructure costs rise dramatically to the sky and the initial investment and ongoing cost would become higher. This has resulted in the development and adaption of dirigibles and their benefits as well as drawbacks while in transport mode in the 1960s being halted for nearly 4 decades while new approaches are sought, although their",

Safety - Dirigibles provide great air safety advantages by being able to land or slow down to drop objects.

Lower costs: As these can take off and land almost at leisure Dirigibles cost to own and run would be dramatically reduced and profits may rise in the near future\nSome Cons Against Dirigibles\n1. Safety risk for humans on surface - There are very many pros of Dirigibles however humans landing Dirigibles in distress have the high risk of being ran over or hurt. \nDirigibles may run safely after a crash, a huge safety risk for those people, and first responders below ground. \nTo increase profit from having the same risk as humans on the ground would be huge.

Cheap to set up: You\u2019ll need at least one net and four paddles and the price won\u2019t be anything near the hundreds to thousands of dollars tennis can cost just for new balls.\n4.

We know the Milwaukee team led the NBA in scoring average and boasted an almost otherworldly +10.3 net rating, best of the entire modern NBA era which spans around four plus decades starting sometime post the Michael Jordan era when he first came in as a Rookie around 1984.  The NBA team holds a good chunk of top awards for the regular season such as most points in total made through normal basketball standards. Several awards as well went to the coaching and support staff.

And lions mane differs from both these species with lion's white ruff and dark stripes down back - no match with others. Taking about size, while lion tends to have heavier, larger body size when compared to male tiger, female lions are typically almost equal height to or heavier than a males tiger's.

The tiger will not generally roar as the lion, as a true tiger does not know how. There is a real difference in the quality of both. Tiger coloration shows three dark orange/dark brown stripes, unlike the common idea of yellow/brown/whitish colors common to lions stripes, whereas the tiger stripes are usually yellow/ orange and pure black. Also, unlike the lion tiger generally are much smaller than most other male/male animals which you would measure by length (chest to back or nose to tail). So also they roam and hunt together generally to be more efficient about taking down animals of their own prey hunting. Aside from different vocalizations, there are several very subtle different physical features, such as ears shape as well.

Gorpro was launched recently last year with a high-resolving lens. The osmo was a highly successful piece of the product by DJi; the pocket 2 had a larger-sized sensor and was launched before. With the stabilizers and more reach to make quality content with better focus with less light were more accessible on larger sensors.

Gimbal stabilizes with pan, tilt or roll movements of up to 140 minutes  or 9 hours if using a smaller size SD Card capacity.\n\nIts has features that suit creators with a budget with limited expenditures with its light weight in hand making easy to port, especially while traveling in the plane, car, bus.\n\nDJI also gives the Osmo product pocket in quality for youtube creator, for those traveling for work, events, and for a quick review about gadgets when needed.
