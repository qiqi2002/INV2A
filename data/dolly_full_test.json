Ultimately the objective of an operating model for AI is to streamline the value generation process from data to business results. Developing AI applications is a highly iterative process and generally strives in an agile environment.  However, organisations operate in a wide variety of contexts and come in many different shapes and sizes, hence it makes sense that there is no universal operating model for AI that fits everywhere. Regulatory requirements, data and resource availability and many other factors will play a role in determining the right operating model. \n\nIt is important then, to have a platform that is able to scale with the organisation as more use cases and users enter the pipeline, as more models are deployed and as more of the business is enhanced by data and AI.

Then position another portion of your hand on top of the other slice of bread to catch the peanut butter. Once caught the peanut butter should be evenly spread on both pieces of bread.

Since about 1900 when the US started tracking and graphing the market, its up nearly ten fold (100000%). Historically, the market has offered an average annual growth rate of around 10%, however like any investment the future is uncertain and there could be years where the market has a negative return, like -20% in 2008 or -17% in 2000. For these reasons, long-term growth has been one of the more stable and risk averse paths to growth.

For investors interested in equities, it is possible to diversify your portfolio to manage those risks. In doing so, it is important to have a plan and, importantly, stick with that plan over the long-term (5-10+ years). There is no guarantee that any investment will grow over time. With diversification and sticking to a plan, growth investments may have the potential to be a good part of an investor\u2019s portfolio.

        "output": [
            "When utilizing public Tesla charging stations, your car will receive either AC or DC electricity for charging the batteries. Tesla recommends AC charging at home since that is the safest and easiest way to charge a Tesla. However, Public AC charging may not always be available, so being able to take advantage of DC charges is useful. The cons are that public charging is slower than charging overnight at home and often requires either waiting to use the charging port since it's located behind a cover on the left side of the charging port door, or bending down very low into the charging port as they seem built for a car's charging port to be higher. When driving, Tesla will also route you around to charge as little as possible and with minimal waiting at the charging stations along the route to your destination. One downside is public charging stations tend to be slower overall, so this route might make your trip longer than necessary or lead to unintended stops at slower than optimal charging stations just to charge your car. Public charging generally is more convenient than the AC charging at home, especially as the charging port is usually easier to access. Over",

There is a network effect where it benefits someone most who chooses to charge at public charging locations frequently to have their car available to drive when needed most (work, school or running errands).  This will influence whether one chooses to charge at home where the car can be charged for cheap overnight or if they\u2019d be flexible to be able to charge at Starbucks and on errands while they\u2019re out anyway and have to pay for the added cost for the charge (usually over-priced convenience stores to get your Tesla charged quickly).  The other influencing factor would be that you are able to go through your day\u2019s errands/tasks/appointments and keep your car charged to reduce range stress in the back of your mind.",

Charging at public stations often results in very high costs, especially if you need to charge to 100% as most cars have larger batteries which need more energy to charge.\n\nAdditionally, public charging stations are generally slower, as many public charging networks operate at a maximum power output of 7kW (11 kW in some cases) Tesla vehicles generally come with more powerful charging hardware enabling speeds of up to 170 kW at stations which support CCS. However this additional hardware does result in added weight which results in a limited charging speed of 58 kW for Tesla vehicles.\n\nIf speed is a factor or your model Tesla supports CCS, you might consider charging at a Supercharger station.",

These charging networks generally have varying levels of pricing that include both time of use and kilowatt pricing. Some charging station networks may also offer packages which can reduce this cost for their members. Another con to note is that for public charging networks that bill the vehicle for charging is generally done through 3rd parties such as credit cards, PayPal and other solutions. This can cause errors in charging if payment is not successful, although most will send a notification and allow you to confirm whether or not to schedule the missed charge or not.

Hence all movies produced in Mumbai and targeting audience mainly consisting of people who speak the Hindi language are generally referred to as Bollywood Movies. In totality Bollywood includes all facets associated with film making - Actor, Actress, Directors, Technicians, Editing, Music and many others. It includes all movies shot, edited and produced inside Bollywood studio situated in Mumbai and is considered the 5th largest contributor of GDP for India which primarily comes from incoming remittance from Non resident Indians (NRI). Bollywood movies are watched over 500 million households outside India which is much more than many matured international film industries e.g. Hollywood"

Fill the vase to about two-thirds full with water. You can add a dash of bleach in the water as well, but it is not necessary. \n3. Now, trim your flowers to the size of the vase. Cut the end of each flower in a diagonal cut. \n4. Remove the leaves from the flowers. This will help to grow the flower without putting resources towards the leaves. Be sure to remove any leaves under the water line, since they can cause infections. \n5. Arrange the flowers in the vase. You can adjust the positions until you are happy with the arrangement.\n6.

            "To start putting fresh flowers into a vase it's important to cut off at least three inches from the stem of the flower. This is important for the hydrangea to grow which provides the best method for absorbing water into the flower. In a clear glass or vase, pour cool water in enough to cover the stems of your freshly washed flowers. Quickly tie the bunch of flowers together as a bouquet so the stem won't bend in the clear water vase and cause too much bend in the stems which may cause the hydrangea not to grow right away to replenish water and the other flowers may start to droop or die immediately if too much water gets into the base of their stems. Finally, arrange your precious flowers in the vase and let enjoy them until they bloom!",
            "First, you'll need to gather your materials. You'll need some flowers (fresh flower is best, but dried flowers will do if it's too expensive), a vase or clear container to hold the water and flowers, and some clear water (preferably tap water). If the vase you have has stems already, you're ready to go! If not, take a knife to cut the stems of the flowers and leave at least two inches off of the top. Next, prepare the vase. Put about an inch and a half of water in the bottom of the vase. You can add a floral additive (often sold with floral supplies) to improve the water's shelf life of the flowers. Next, cut the stems of the flowers under running water and take away those annoying fibers from the stems. Dunk the flowers in the prepared water and arrange the flowers into your vase. Now relax and enjoy those gorgeous flowers!",

Different chemical reactions may occur between your flowers and dirt. Some will bloom better, other wilton.\nTrim you flowers as much as you would like to adjust the sizes to fit in the vase. Usually the shorter the flowers are, the fuller the vase will look with less foliage showing. Tear or cut the foliage; if the stems are long, they will not fit well in the vase and usually will cause foaming at the mouth when the flowers get water. You will see the stems get thicker and the outer layers become softer and softer after a few days, which enables you to cut them without any residue after one or two days if desired. Remove 1-3 inches from the bottom of the flowers, changing the direction a little bit is nice too. Submerge all the stems at a time in the water so the flowers can absorb water fully. If the water turns cloudy, use distilled water for aesthetic reasons and prevent bacteria/bugs",

Flowers that do well in a vase are carnations, alstroemeria, ecuadorians (tropicals flowers), strelitzias, hydrangea, roses, peonies, tulips. Different flowers bloom at different times so try a seasonal flower next. If you use recycled vases that were previously filled with water, the bacteria already in the vase may promote growth and encourage blooming even more. Always use very fresh water to fill a vase! It is also best to cut 1\" of the top of the stem diagonally to encourage absorption when filling the vase."

It's also important to note that different coffee beans produce vastly different flavour notes; so you may need to choose the right coffee bean for the kind of taste you want to produce. This is a much more nuanced area then most people would expect but having good coffee beans is an important first step to making a good cappuccino.",

After filling your espresso machine's portafilter, wipe away any excess coffee oils with a clean shop towel and then fill the portafilter with the appropriate amount of ground coffee. Make sure to level the grounds when loading the portafilter, this will increase your chances of achieving an excellant shot of espresso.\nWhen you have your espresso shot pulled, use that rich, delicious shot of espresso to steam and froth your milk using a steam wand fitted to your espresso machine. Steam the milk for 5-10 seconds to achieve a silky-smooth texture and at the same time holding the bottom of the cup of milk with the frothed milk mixture pour the frothed espresso into a cup, and voila!

This condition has historically been thought by some medical professionals to be \"a nuisance symptom with no known cause\", however many medical professionals and sports experts believe that the cause is most likely related to some combination of overuse and/orial stress and repetitive motion; others believe that the cause could be attributed to other stress related factors such as poor or worn out tennis shoes, improper stringing of a tennis racket, and some believe it could be caused by playing on courts with irregular \"pocket\" areas where a person might repeatedly drop their feet.  \n\nThe symptom typically presents itself when serving a tennis ball and/or hitting the ball with a racket, and some consider it to be quite a common injury among tennis players, especially professional players such as Martina Hingis and Sam Stosur.",

It is predominately due to the tennis leg syndrome when a lateral ligament in the knee is injured from the repeatedly hitting the ball with sidewards force.  There are usually lots of lateral movements as one hits the ball.  One of the exercises is hitting a lot of forehands and backhands to the same direction (right or left), this helps strengthens those specific parts of the muscle.  Repeated motion happens all the time in tennis because when you hit a ball, it travels at you pretty fast, you have to respond and react very quickly, usually under a second to react.",
            "A tennis leg injury occurs when a tennis player jumps up and extends their leg when hitting a forehand or other shot, over-rotates the leg with force beyond their capacity for that point in the game. As they push off, their leg rotates the other way - or inverted or reversed rotation. This puts tremendous twisting forces on the knee causing potential dislocations, and damages or tears around the knee structure. When competitive tennis players experience this they will continue to play as they must keep the momentum going into the follow through. When finished, their coach or trainer will assess and help them down from the court by grabbing their waist and assistance with balance, or assisting into a seat. If players feel severe pain and they lose control of their movement, they often fall to the ground in a distorted position and are incapable of keeping balance in this situation - and frequently fall or are helped to sit down."

To compare the two: if we log base 10 we get $1.303920648 x 10^{-9}$; so they are roughly the same on a scientific scale.",

            "A subfield of data science, data engineering focuses on the building and maintenance of data systems and databases, including design, construction, testing, deployment, and performance monitoring of these systems. An data engineer's work is typically operational in nature and involves working with large data sets and various technologies to collect, transform, and load data into various databases and data warehouses.\n\nIn the past, organizations might have relied on a single enterprise data warehouse to collect and report information from their organization. Modern data architecture, however, often incorporates dozens of analytics and reporting systems in the form of data lakes, data marts, and data warehouses from a mix of different vendors, in addition to a myriad of data sources and other \"source\" systems. In many cases, these additional systems may not provide straightforward direct data access, and so organizations require a data engineering capability in order to collect, transform and load the data into an analytic or reporting system. As a result, data engineering has become an important role within many organizations. In organizations that have implemented a data warehouse-oriented data architecture, data engineers typically play an important role in constructing and maintaining",
            "Data engineering is a process to transform an organization's data by building an infrastructure that allows data to be ingested, transformed, and analysed in an timely fashion so it can support a data rich organization. The data processing needed is often beyond simple data aggregations and involves using statistical methods, and using different kinds of algorithmic techniques that apply statistical theory and practice such as hypothesis testing to the problem of data processing to allow you to build models with much higher precision on a statistically significant basis over a much larger dataset scale needed to gain the level of trust in the analysis required by modern analytic users (which can be measured as the amount of predicted business outcome which is the revenue that your dashboard drives). This results in dashboards and associated model driven reporting applications and alerts which in turn enable the organisation to achieve its goals by changing the way it interacts with its users based on the factual predictive outcomes of realtime predictive model-based applications running on top of a large volume of trustworthy structured, semi-structured and even unstructured data in all its forms in one single integrated system architecture. Data Engineers design and create the pipelines, process workflows and underlying database structures that data flows through.",

Data engineers make large volumes of data ready for analysis at an economic scale by designing databases, optimizing queries, and building automated processes. Like a data analyst, they want to make the most of the data they already have, but their focus is scaling to petabyte-level databases and ensuring performance in queries that reference the entirety of the data. Like a data scientist, they ensure that their models see the relevant data and get trustworthy answers about customers, operations, and more. In general, a data engineer has to balance scalability and performance versus data quality. Scalability/performance trumps quality 80% of the time (thousands to millions of flows, tens to hundreds of thousands of consumers), with small amounts of 100% quality data guaranteed for the occasional flows / dashboards / customer requests.",

This is the single most important factor that will make your tzatziki source exceptional.\n2) Fine-chop the dill leaves using a knife. The dill must be fresh. The volume of the chopped dill leaves should be about the same as the volume of the squeezed grated cucumber.\n3) Mix the cucumber and the dill with Greek strained yoghurt . The latter should have a volume that is three to four times that of the cucumber and dill.\n4) Add some salt and smashed cloves of fresh garlic.\n5) Add a couple of teaspoons of balsamic vinegar.\n6) While stirring the mix, gradually keep adding extra virgin olive oil until the sauce obtains a silky texture.\n7) Do not add any other ingredients in the mix.\n8) Place the mix in the fridge and keep it for a couple of hours and let chemistry do its magic.\n9) Remove the residual water, if any, which may have surfaced.\n10) Stir the mix once more final time and serve in smaller containers.",

            "A good place to begin would be with truly superior ingredients.  For beginners (pun intended), the core 2 ingredients in tzatziki sauce are usually the cucumber and sour cream. You really should do your best to use the freshest items available - in season and at the peak of freshness.  Of course you will need an old fashion cucumber, rather than one that is hydro-gowned.   Using real greek yoghurt or sour cream will greatly enhance the overall quality.  Next you have multiple options on how to complete the profile of the sauce. Some folks prefer a spicy component using hot peppers - usually jalapenos or banana peppers.  If you go the heat route, be advised that using hot peppers that  are not Greek produces results that are very obvious from a country of origin perspective (ie: taste of pepper) -- best to use items you have grown yourself to maximize the realism of the dish. Last but not least, add a healthy pinch of salt and a sprinkle of cracked black pepper.  There are several variations that can be employed on",
            "I am a proponent of whole foods, preferring not to use ingredients such as pasteurized milk or seed oils, and instead choosing to go the unprocessed foods route. Instead of using just sour cream, I prefer to use yoghurt as the base, as it will naturally curdle when combined with the acidity from the mix of juices (such as lemon and vinegar). It also gives it a much better texture -- instead of being a smooth creamy uniform base, you'll have a textured and slightly grainy mixture. Of course if you want a smoother mixture you could always strain it or use it in a food processor for a bit until you're pleased with the texture.\n\nI also add some olive oil, which enhances the other Greek taste of the mix (which is primarily lemon) by adding its own bright yet earthy note. Don't be stingy with the olive oil -- it's key in making the flavors fully flourish, as it serves both as a carrier oil for the other ingredients and helps it stick together when you toss the mix.\n\nFor further extra flavor",
            "If what set your tzatziki apart was something entirely unique that you invented yourself, and the inventiom would shock the consumer into a pleasantly positive feeling, then you might truly stand apart. As of today, no tzatziki tastes like kale and cayenne. Give it a shot!",
            "The ingredients you put in and more specifically the freshness of the ingredients are of upmost importance to making a truly exceptional tzatziki sauce. Apart from the common ingredients of yogurt, cucumber, garlic and salt & pepper, consider some of the following for that extra something:\n- 25g finely chopped pistachios (or walnuts or cashews) \n- 1 clove crushed fresh garlic\n- Fresh dill weed sprigs (about 10-15g) \n- Fresh parsley sprigs (about 10-15g)\n- 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika\n- Fresh cilantro, roughly chopped (about 2 tablespoons)\nSome would argue that the 90% of the trick is the freshness of the ingredients. While cucumbers are typically quite easy to find at good supermarkets, the same cannot be said about fresh pistachios.

        "label": "Running barefoot tends to shift the striking point of the foot to the balls of the feet, rather than the heels as people commonly do while wearing shoes. Some evidence shows that this front foot-first pattern can reduce the risk of many running-related injuries. However, running barefoot is also more painful, especially on rough terrain or in the cold. Therefore, most people opt to run while wearing shoes.",
        "output": [
            "I think it would hurt if you run barefoot, because then you are in direct contact with the hard concrete/asphalt and your skin is no barrier anymore. Additionally, there could be sharp things in the ground and they would puncture into your feet. So yes, that would definitely hurt the first couple of times! Being barefoot outside of your own yard or home typically comes with extra danger because there are more sharp objects and rough textures outside of where you normally go barefoot. But yes, studies have shown that we walked differently when we're barefoot (which is a great thing we should be doing a lot more of), which would positively affect our health. If we walk barefoot more often we may also learn how to use our feet and bodies to communicate better with each other and how to protect and avoid injuries instead of relying on external things like shoes all the time, which would be a healthy way of building mental toughness. I believe that all of those things make going barefoot a positive thing to do for your health and for how you interact with your surroundings and use your own body. That is how I would answer your questions based on the facts provided.",
            "There would be different effects depending on weather or not you wear shoes, but there is one aspect to consider: the impact of wearing shoes. In contrast to barefoot running, it is better to have some protection (like shoes). Although it has some pro's too, when talking about the fact that you avoid impact (when we don't wear shoes we have the tendency to bite the ground/road harder than with shoes). So, while wearing shoes has its pros, it is not necessarily \"good\" if we run barefoot since there is the tradeoff of using shoes to avoid impact versus not use shoes and get hurted by the biting down on the earth.\nIn general it is a big decision whether to wear shoes or not. There has been a trend over the last decade where it's get more common to run barefoot, however this still depends on the conditions too. When you run on good surfaces like asphalt, concrete or very solid roads, it is generally better to wear shoes. Barefoot running starts to get reasonable when the terrain is not so hard or rough. It is recommended to start gradually when changing from wearing shoes to not",
            "If you run barefoot, your foot will land more directly below you, avoiding the high-energy-transfer shoes, more pronounced heel strike associated with many modern running shoes. Running barefoot or in minimalist footwear is becoming more and more popular among the distance running community.",
            "It depends on why you are running and why you want to run barefoot. People who run barefoot or in minimalist shoes tend to have more mid-foot strikes, which can be easier on the body long-term. When runners wear shoes with heels and substantial arch support, there\u2019s less midfoot and forefoot striking and more heel striking. This creates the risk of injuries like plantar fasciitis or stress fractures. \n\nMany runners like the sensation of running barefoot and enjoy the increased connection to the trail or road. For others, the discomfort outweighs the positives, which is totally valid. For marathon training or longer distances, I still prefer runners have some type of protection, especially for extreme trails."

Most often this is in reference to pick-up trucks, as those vehicles come from the manufacturer with the front of the vehicle at a lower height than the rear.  Know as a \"rake\", this is intended to allow the vehicle to ride at a level height even when carrying significant weight in the truck bed or towing heavy trailers.  There are various methods for lifting a vehicle that range from inexpensive spacers to elevate factory springs to more comprehensive systems replacing multiple suspension elements with new, purpose-built components.  People often prefer to lift their truck for the aesthetic appeal as well as improved ground clearance and performance when driving off-road.",
        "output": [
            "There isn't just one reason to lift your truck but most do it for aesthetic reasons.  They want to make their truck more aggressive looking which can be based on their personality and how they drive. Lifting your truck also makes the tire more accessible for changes in weather. The more serious off-road drivers may also utilize larger tires on their lifted truck but there isn't a direct correlation. People do lift their trucks for that off-road feel but you can achieve that with larger wheels or just getting the attitude adjusted with an alignment from your mechanic. So why not make my truck look tough? There is not downside!",
            "Most of the people have trucks just for the purpose of off-roading.  They typically lower their suspension so that they can get a bit more clearance when navigating uneven roads and have better approach and departure angles so they can drive over rocks, branches and other obstacles without damaging their prized possession.  A higher clearance would help these drivers to get past some of the obstacles which they are aiming to avoid by driving a raised suspension truck.\nMost drivers who drive trucks have a fixation with its potential to be able to drive over any obstacle without any damage which typically stems from a deep seated insecurity that their wife/girlfriend bought them the truck out of obligation to help them out when the truck is in fact for recreational activities rather than an attempt to solve the actual issue and get some confidence which comes with taking care of a asset that is used every day for a functional purpose.\nLowering ones suspension is more of a status symbol than an actual attempt to solve a real world problem where a higher clearance actually resolves.",
            "There are many reasons, mostly aesthetic and societal pressure that comes with owning a pickup truck, such as having bigger tires. Other reasons are increased off-roading capabilities and ease. \nFor example if someone needs to have a higher profile, i.e. need to reach something on top of a tall shelf, it's much easier with a raised truck, given that they have the same interior space height of the seats.",
            "When people say they want to \"lift\" their truck or SUV, they are usually talking about increasing the suspension travel, typically to raise the vehicle off the ground. There are usually three things you need to be able to lift a truck: be strong enough to lift and steer it yourself, have enough clearance (room) in your garage, and be willing to pay for it. Increasing suspension travel enables higher clearance, as the vehicles sits farther from the ground. Typical methods include using bigger struts or springs, adding a block of some sort above and/or below a leaf spring pack (typical on trucks or largerSUVs), using a torsion key, or converting to a coil spring pack with the appropriate spacers. You can even convert to a four-wheel drive configuration which offers better clearance than the typical rear-wheel drive configuration.  However, lifting a vehicle does more than gain clearance. Lifted vehicles often have significantly greater approach angle which can help getting over rocks, logs, dirt mounds, and the like, as well as departure angle which helps from slipping off upturned surfaces or going off-road"

The fall in bond price occurs because newly issued bonds at a higher rate of interest can replace an existing bond's income stream at the same yield, since the newer bonds of new issue carry same coupon rate that bond investors were willing to accept at the earlier date. The interest-rate rise would lower a bond's price, since investors need a lower yield to be attracted to buy the existing bond whose price is falling.\n\nIt can also measure the maximum gross potential return of an individual bond when interest rates move.

            "A quark is a type of elementary particle in the universe, which is the smallest kind of matter that still has the properties of matter, such as having mass and volume. Exactly six types of quarks exist. They have been observed experimentally and are categorized by their intrinsic properties and behavior, such as how they interact with each other or with radiation.",
            "The word \"quark\" is borrowed from a term invented by John D. Rodker in his 1969 short story The Word for World is Forest, where it designated a monetary unit, a small stack of which could be taken as change from a gavige, and large stacks of which were used for trade.\n\nIn the sense of a small amount, usage of the word currency began around 1985 by graduate students on the Stony Brook University campus and spread rapidly through local students after the idea that the word \"quark\" could be used to refer the smallest units of currency was codified in L. Frank Baum's Oz/WONDerful books, as the term was employed as a form of currency in one or more novels."

Prior to the Dead, most singers and bands had short three to four minute songs, that were crisp but didn't allow for the musicians in the band to take risks.  They were just playing from the songbook and the notes written down.  The Dead allowed for a more fluid approach, and provided the musicians with opportunities to go off script, and just play for the love of creating music.    The Jam genre they created led to many other bands performing in a similar style and openness, including Phish, Dave Matthews band, Widespread Panic, Blues Travelers and many more.  The Dead(as they are often called) started the trend though, and will be forever memorialized because of that.",

During their peak time (early '80s - '94) Jerry Garcia, one of the bands principal singers and guitar players, struggled with a long serious dip in heroin addiction.  In that era people viewed him as \"rebel bad-boy\".  \n\nBy 1994 Jerry overcame his addiction.  Post his recovery, Jerry was not longer in that \"edgy rebel persona\"  this alienated a portion of the remaining fan base whom still viewed Jerry as the aforementioned \"rebel-bad-boy\" in which they loved because he was doing drugs. In reality, the person who was \"doing drugs\" during peak years of the Dead was bassist Bill Kreutzmann who is a recovering addict.",
            "While every Grateful Dead fan may have their own take, there are a few central concepts that seem key to many diehard fans. Many Grateful Dead fans grew up listening to their first dead show with their parents as teenagers. This \"dead\" was not hallucinogenic, like LSD, but rather the Dead meant the band Grateful Dead; Jerry Garcia was at the time the most identifiable member of the band. Typical \"jam band\" fans, a demographic associated with the dead, listened to the band via albums before ever seeing them live. \n\nA Grateful Dead concert is an exceptionally prolonged concert - up to five and a half hours is not uncommon. Fans would camp outside with tickets to their \"lot\" section (the parking lot next to the concert venue that sold \"tier 1\" tickets) for days or weeks in advance. It has been known that entire families attend Grateful Dead shows, especially during summer vacation.\n\nFor many fans, the appeal of the Grateful Dead reside in the unpredictability inherent in these live shows.

To be \"Dead Head\" one needed to go to see a series of shows, sometimes many days in a row. These committed fans will see anyone, anytime, anywhere and travel in droves for \"DEAD\" shows. \nBeing a \"Dead Head\" during their peak (1980-1995) was considered cool by many. During the years Jerry Garcia went into the band (70's - 1995) the band continued through the fans love and enthusiasm but were less active. Without Jerry Garcia the band didn't tour much, but had many musicians take turns \"subbing\" on guitar. The chemistry was never quite the same without Jerry, as he was the main creative composer of music in the band. Even thought the core band wasn't together, the band's huge fanbase kept the \"dead\" alive though albums sales (",

Unlike most bands that fit into one genre, the Dead played to a variety of fan bases.    This is evident when seeing them perform.  Audiences were made up of 1) former hippies who were a large following for the band in their heyday, 2) current hippies who likely discovered them through their parents who were fans or 3) younger crowds who came to experience the Dead with their families on Summer holiday trips.\nIts hard to imagine that a band that had their rise to fame during the tumultuous time of the late 60s and 70s with one of the main band members dying from an overdose and another dying in a strange 199"

            "Buying a multi-unit property can be a cost-effective way to acquire several living spaces. There are a couple advantages that may tip the scale toward buying a multi-unit residential building as a first-time home buyer:  \n1. If you purchase a smaller unit that's currently occupied by a tenant, the monthly rent could offset part of your mortgage expense, saving you money immediately\n2. You have ownership of an asset while creating equity by renting out the other units. Typically the residential real estate market increases value over time, therefore, the property's value likely would appreciate during the years you own the building. If you choose to sell the property when you sell your units, you could potentially profit on the equity built over the years.\nSome pros and cons for a multi-unit property as your first property may include:\n- You already own income-producing real estate\n- You have multiple options to scale in the future, selling units as desired, expanding your reach across other units\n- You will be responsible for many more responsibilities than owning a single-family dwelling.

Buying two adjacent units for one larger price than what the seller would sell them both for independently could sound like a great deal, especially if it would allow you to get a better mortgage rate or get closer to your desired square footage requirements. It can also make it easier to stage your financial plan and accounting for your future mortgage rates. \n\nHowever, there could also be significant costs tied to purchasing a multiple-unit property that you should carefully evaluate before deciding to buy such a property. Purchasing and maintaining multiple units may add additional risk to your financial health plan as you now have multiple properties or building projects to evaluate and manage instead of one; having multiple real estate holdings can provide excellent diversification for your investment profile; it can also introduce additional complexity in your financial plan or accounting and reduce the expected risk profile and diversification of your financial situation."

It is correct to describe someone as very kind, but if someone asks how good someone is at a particular task, that someone can only be described as good. Adverbs can also provide information regarding frequency. Words like often, frequently and regularly are examples of this.  Adjectives on the other hand provide information about what kind of description is being made. Words like nice and good are examples of adjectives, when used as describing words, they will describe the thing they are describing. Nice is an adjective when used to describe the phrase very nice holiday.",

An adjective would modify a noun or pronoun whereas an adverb would modify a verb.  The difference, however, lies in their endsings. An adjective's form ends in -ly; for example, clever becomes cleverly. The verb ends in -ly does modify the stem of the verb, such as \"walk\" becoming \"walkly.\" Walkly is not a regular verb though so don't try to use this in a sentence! An adverb is just the stem of the verb with no ending; therefore, walk becomes just \"walk\" which makes it an adverb itself and can be used in a sentence like: She walked with great walk which makes great an adjective to describe \"walk\".  \n\nI hope that helps clarify the difference adverbs and adjectives for you!",

            "There isn't a single \"best\" programming language. Popular choices do vary based on what type of application the language is being used to develop, as well as who's opinion you're asking for. Some languages are designed for high-performance computing, others for general scripting, yet others for developing web applications. Some of the most popular languages include Java, C, C++, Python and Rust.",
            "Choosing a programming language to accomplish a specific task depends on your personal preferences and needs as well as various project specifications that are based on your goals for that project. Most languages are similar in function and have similar constructs. However, they vary widely in terms of learning curves, ecosystem, popularity, and performance. Python is the most used language overall. It has become very popular among new coders as it has a very approachable and minimalist design that makes it simple to learn and easy to begin writing code in. C# is also extremely popular, largely used for Microsoft and Windows projects. Many professional embedded developers like to use C because it has low-level kernel capabilities that allow direct access to hardware functions. Java has also been used in a lot of enterprise software projects due to its closed nature. Java applications are typically compiled so it allows for better performance on the user's computer and on remote servers whereas a Python application is typically run from a web server hence its performance is dependant on the network.",
            "There is no single answer to this question. While many programmers swear by a particular language, others claim that any language can be used well or that the best language is the one you learn first (first-language bias). A commonly used but difficult language with a steep learning curve is Haskell, while simple and easy-to-learn languages include Julia and Rust. Python is often cited as a good language to learn first because of its minimalist syntax. The answer depends on what is being developed, whether it is being developed by an individual or a company, and what libraries and frameworks are already being used.",

Without oil, these surfaces will rub against one another and cause permanent damage and unrecoverable damage to the engine. Always use the engine oil type that is suggested by your car's manufacturer, and change the oil at the suggested interval. For many modern cars, this is either every 12 months or after 5000 to 10000 miles, whichever come first.",
        "output": [
            "Most vehicles come with the recommendation to change the oil every few thousand miles, typically in the range of 3,000-5,000 miles.\nThe oil breaks down from contamination of dirt, grime and wear particles from inside the engine. It becomes less able to properly lubricate all the moving parts inside the engine. In many cases, dirty oil or low levels of oil lead to costly repairs to engines that could have been avoided. Oil changes are inexpensive but neglecting to do so, can lead to very costly repairs down the line.\n\nBeyond just cost, neglecting to change the oil can lead to potentially very harmful damage to your car or truck\u2019s engine. You\u2019ve likely seen the advertising, your truck or car does have a \"synthetic\" oil option at the dealership for an added cost.

Oil is added into the engine to not only lubricate this friction, but also to remove the metal particles generated from this friction. By not changing the oil, these metal particles will not be removed, and will remain in the engine; gradually increasing the damage on the engine. Changing the oil, means removing these metal particles from the engine, and ensuring all the moving parts of the engine are oiled and well-lubricated to keep the engine in good health and running efficiently.",

If you drive a while with carbon buildup from the last combustion in the engine (from not changing oil), the oil might be thick enough to prevent proper movement of the parts inside the engine and result in car breaking down. In worst cases with too much time between oil changes, it may destroy the engine from the inside. The heat the engine generated from running makes water from fuel evaporate in the cylinders which is used by spark plugs to create the next combustion cycle, also causes oil's viscosity to decrease and lubrication performance reduces which is why you need to change the oil for a new one with additives from a gas station from time to time. If you don't want your engine to suffer from carbon buildup or permanent damage from old oil, do an oil and filter change according to car's manual.",

As of today, a decent professional digital camera significantly outperforms the 35mm film cameras in terms of resolution, burst-shooting capabilities, nearly unlimited storage, and etc... In the recent years, the \"film look\" has made its comeback with lower resolution, grainy texture and unique color rendition. On top of that, half-decent retro-looking film cameras can be acquired for much less than a potent digital camera, lowering the entry barrier for those on the budget and looking for that look. An abundant pool of film stocks also adds to the fun, where each can drastically differ in low-light sensitivity, color rendition, graininess, post-processing chemistry, and of course, price. However, many major photographic film producers have either discontinued or significantly reduced the volume of their production. This, coupled with the surge in the demand, has led to skyrocketing prices on most of the still-available film stocks. On top of this, many popular and sought-after film cameras like the Leica M6, Nikon FM2 and Contax T2 also saw steep increase in their used-market prices. Given these price hikes on films and decades-old equipments, film photography is quickly becoming an expensive hobby, where each click of a shutter could cost more than 50 cents.

You will need multiple backups for film, just in case you run out mid-shoot too, as carrying around spares can be a burden.

Finally, everyone and their dog has access to a DSLR and has more or less the same setup as thousands of other DSLR owners. If everyone took photos like the other",
            "Many film photographers are drawn to the art form because of a perceived lack of imperfections when compared to their digital counterparts. One characteristic of film that stands out is how each photographer, regardless of skill or experience level, captures a roll of film differently. This yields a distinct array of color palettes, highlight and shadow details, and even grain structures. While some may view this variety as \u201cugly\u201d when compared to digitally constructed photographs which can be corrected extensively during post-production, film photographers will view the unique qualities of each photograph separately as artwork, rather than trying to correct everything within an inch of its digital life. This mentality causes photographers to approach each photo separately as an artwork in-and-of-itself, rather than just part of a series. By no means are imperfections a flaw, but when you consider it in the context of postmodernism and the embracing of variation in place of uniformity, film offers a liberating aesthetic not often afforded to photographers using other mediums."

Some stories span only a few strips, but they all work well together. Some strips contain philosophy, some have anthropomorphic animals with talking flowers and snow people, some feature time travel, aliens, cows in space, explorers, pir",

            "Timing is everything. If they are lucky, there is a reasonable opportunity the victim might still be alive for a significant period of time (several days). However, the longer it takes, the chances of finding the victim alive, declines exponentially. So, in cases of kidnapping, it's critical the police start looking for the kidnapper within the 1st 48 hrs after the crime to maximize the chances of finding the victim alive. Unfortunately, more often than not, we hear about abductions and killings many years after the heinous crime has been committed. Therefore, police should not have a time limitation for investigations and make sure they don't stop pursuing even one tip, no matter how minute that might come in years or decades later.",
            "There are several different factors that determine the most important thing for law enforcement in a kidnapping case, however the most important thing would have to be searching for the kidnapped person as fast as humanly possible. This increases the chances the person will be found alive. Once discovered the police will be trained to take action to not only save the life of the victim, but also apprehend the kidnapper. The faster these actions happen, the more lives will be saved.",

If an image of the kidnapped child is available in a short period of time of 2 to 3 hours the likelihood the kidnapped child can be found in highest degree successful increase. This includes fingerprint images and images of tire tracks, foot prints. The second most important piece of information law enforcement needs to look for a kidnapped person is; where were the final known last seen locations or where the kidnapped person last used their cell phone. Once the location of the kidnapped person is determine police SWAT team can look into finding the kidnapped person safe. The longer kidnapped person is keep kidnapped the higher rate for kidnapping to murder occurs. It is extremely important law enforcement gets an immediate image of the kidnapped person to increase chances of finding the person alive and safe.",
            "It is the timeline. Most times the longer the case goes cold and the passage of time has affected the physical evidence the more it interferes with the ability to effectively and correctly collect and analyze the physical evidence for use in court. When dealing with kidnapping the sooner law enforcement can and does collect the various forms of evidence it directly contributes to a much higher rate of solving the case before too much time has elapsed that affects the possibility of a successful prosecution. Law enforcement knows that it takes team work and collecting as much physical evidence as soon as possible are most likely to result in a successful prosecution."

        "label": "Deafblindness is the condition of little or no useful hearing and little or no useful sight. Different degrees of vision loss and auditory loss occur within each individual. Because of this inherent diversity, each deafblind individual's needs regarding lifestyle, communication, education, and work need to be addressed based on their degree of dual-modality deprivation, to improve their ability to live independently. In 1994, an estimated 35,000\u201340,000 United States residents were medically deafblind. Helen Keller was a well-known example of a deafblind individual. To further her lifelong mission to help the deafblind community to expand its horizons and gain opportunities, the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults (also called the Helen Keller National Center or HKNC), with a residential training program in Sands Point, New York, was established in 1967 by an act of Congress.\n\nThe deafblind community has its own culture, comparable to those of the deaf community and the blind community. Members of the deafblind community have diverse backgrounds but are united by similar experiences and a shared, homogeneous understanding of what it means to be deafblind. Some deafblind individuals view their condition as a part of their identity.",

            "Deafblindness is a combination of deafness and blindness. In simpler terms a deafblind person is a person that experiences a significant degree of difficulty in one or more of the basic senses (sight, hearing, mobility, taste, and smell)",
            "Deafblindness occurs when a person experiences a combined loss of hearing and vision. To a typical sighted person, darkness is just an opportunity for their eyes to adjust and see better after some time. But to a deafblind person, darkness is their whole life - all the time. Deafblind people live in darkness all the time, not knowing whether it's day or night, hot or cold, sunny or raining. All deafblindness awareness events aim to bring attention to these facts and how deafblind people need extra support to stay safe. Deafblind people are at a higher accident rate as they tend to walk into things because of a lack of visual feedback. They are also a higher risk for depression, anxiety and other mental health issues that comes from the isolation and lack of communication and connection.",
            "Deafblindness  can be a few different things: Firstly, it can refer to someone who is deaf (has no usable hearing). Usually it signifies that this person has a usable degree of sight that allows them to read or interpret written or printed language and maybe visual symbol sets like braille. However, when speaking with others the term 'deafblind' generally  applies someone has moderate to complete profound deafness  in both ears combined with very limited to no functional sight; i.e. almost totally blind with some extremely limited light perception. As a third definition the phrase can be used more colloquially when referring to 'those' people who have typical or better ability in speech and/ or hearing but struggle with visual perception i.e. seeing. For example it is typical to hear a deaf person sign \"I'm deafblind\",  meaning their speech is okay but they miss visual cues very often or can't read people's lips at all. Deafblindness does not infer to when someone is hard of hearing or 'almost' deaf and almost blind; those are other conditions all together. As one might expect there is a"

When you are ready to start installing your fence, you would Dig holes using a post digger at intervals between 3 to 5 feet wide. He would then pour concrete into the holes and put the fence posts in the holes. After the posts are installed, and the concrete is dried, you would nail the wooden planks between the posts to make your fence.

            "To install a wooden fence you first need to determine if it is legal to install a fence on your property. A 6 foot fence is common to allow for plants to grow to either side of it. You will determine how many fence posts are needed and where they will be set to determine the pattern in which the fence will be built. Posts should be augured into the ground. Once all the posts are set, the horizontal slats (called sident) are nailed to the vertical posts. Once the horizontal sident is attached and the 3/4\" x 3-5' boards of wood that comprise the actual fence itself are installed it is suggested you paint or seal your fence to ensure long life. To dig holes for fence posts you will likely want to use a post-hole digger attached to a drill or, if you prefer not to rent a drill, you could try finding an older/bigger power auger in the garage or attic and pulling it down to dig holes with one of those instead.",

Ensure you have wooden posts that are longer than your soil is deep to ensure concrete won't wash away over time and your fence posts are set deep into the ground.  Use a trencher to dig holes for your wooden posts. Drill pilot holes for your fence post into the concrete in each hole before pouring concrete around your post, and be sure to let the concrete set before removing your m drill.  Use an impact driver and 2\u201d screws for the 2x4s and decking screws for the 2x2s when assembling your fence panels.

Also, typically the team has to move the ball 75 to 80 yards to the end zone. Only a few strong armed quarterbacks can throw that far. Even fewer can do it under pressure. The other main issue is that there is a very low chance of completing the pass. \n\nSo, smart teams and coaches, use a variety of strategies of both throwing the ball different distances, running the ball, and based on distance, kicking field goals. One of the key strategies is to mix it up, so that there is an element of surprise and the defense is caught off-guard.",

The reason is that since touchdowns are so highly valued (worth 7 points total), doing what gets the most touchdowns will ultimately lead to the most points. However, as well noted above, sometimes it is not prudent to throw the ball to the end zone every time for several key reasons. \n\nIn terms of risk vs reward, throwing to the end zone has both very high reward (a touchdown = 7 points immediately) and very high risk (fumbles or interceptions lead to -2 points or -6 points, respectively). In between the two scenarios (not every time), teams run the football, which moves the football closer to the end zone on every snap, but generally carries a lot less risk than passing and yields positive reward most of the time (a yard per rush = 1 point at the end zone). \n\nThus, although throwing to the end zone always feels like the best idea, since it can generate the most points immediately, sometimes it is better to take the guaranteed reward today and play conservatively to maximize your scoring over an entire",
            "Because the NFL and collegiate football are designed with a point incentive to score (more points the better chance to win), there are two things that are against the rules to prevent abuse. If a team constantly threw the ball to the end zone (very difficult to defend, and highest point score), the league would penalize them by:\n1. They would be flagged/penalized a 'fair catch' kick infraction, or\n2. They would waste a time out, or\n3. The opposing defense could decline the subsequent touchdown scored.",
            "You would think that scoring as many points as possible is the main objective of the team on offense, but this is not necessarily the case. On average, a football game is split between 3 to 4 drives for each team. Therefore, spiking the ball on the one-yard line each time before kneeling down is essentially giving up 90%+ of your available yardage each time in an effort to avoid scoring six points. Not all points are created equal here because the scoring is based on the number of attempts you have on each drive which leads to a team's number of possessions. The idea that the football team that scored the most points will most likely win is true but there is still something called \"playing not to lose\" where a good defense would rather let the offense have it's six points after a made extra point because that is the only thing they need to win (or keep from losing) in certain circumstances.  In the playoffs, you rarely see this happen but most of the analysts agree you don't want to win a game of fewer than 21 to 27 points. In overtime with a tied game, don't get too cute too as you never",
            "The simple answer is it's not that easy. There are more defenders in the end zone than you might think. In fact the number one rule for first-time rookie quarterbacks is to never throw a pass that is not catchable in the NFL which greatly limits the need to throw into the end zone. There will be an occasional home run, however expecting too many is simply a recipe for failure in the NFL and most lower levels for that matter.

Some other uncommon birthdays in the West are January 1, December 24, and April 1.\n\nThe least common birthday is usually a holiday when most people take time off work. There are multiple reasons why these days have fewer births, but one reason is that doctors are less likely to schedule cesarean births on such days. April 1 is an exception, and is likely because parents who are able to choose not to give birth on that day, to prevent their children from being bullied for having their birthday on April Fool's Day.\n\nThis question is harder to answer in many non-Western countries as there is less easily accessible data. For example in a survey of students in India between 2007 and 2012, the statistics show much more births just before school opens, and on round days like the 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th.

Though there are many strategies to beat procrastination, the effectiveness of these strategies is largely dependent on the individual and his/her/their circumstances. Here are some popular strategies to beat procrastination:\n\n1. Set realistic, specific, and time-bound goals. The best goals should have some built-in time delays, but not too much, as to maintain some urgency. Large goals should also be broken into achievable chunks. \n\n2. Limit your access to distracting media. Making use of your device's focus modes, or locking away your device all together when working can prevent you from being distracted while executing tasks\n\n3. Make the rewards of accomplishing goals tangible and more immediate. A popular strategy for this is temptation bundling, where you bundle a behavior that is good for you in the long-run with a behavior that feels good in the short-run. For example, you may only allow yourself to watch YouTube videos while you are folding laundry.\n\n4. Use support systems. Often, using peers, family, or other individuals in your support system to help hold you accountable is an effective way to encourage task accomplishment. This method also promotes social interaction and continuous discussion of goals with others. As a caveat, you should not become reliant on this method, as it can create burdens on the other individuals in your support system",

Ensure that everything required to complete a given task is in one place, and remove any other tempting distractions that are not helping your cause.\n\nSet deadlines. Make it a goal to complete certain activities as fast as you can. It can be to the minute, to the hour, or even to the day; what matters is setting a timeline that is reasonable for you. It will motivate you to get moving on those things that have a tight timeline.\n\nBe consistent.

Most RVs work off a \u201ctank\u201d system, with sink and shower water going into the \u201cgray\u201d tank and toilet waste going into the \u201cblack\u201d tank. These tanks then need to be emptied on a regular basis dependent on their capacity. Toilets that work with a tank system tend to work like residential toilets, but use less water and have a foot pedal for flushing. There are two other types of toilets found often in DIY conversion RVs or \u201coff-grid\u201d RVs. First, cassette toilets are essentially holding tanks for toilet waste that are then pulled out of the RV and manually emptied. The \u201ccassette\u201d portion of the toilet is often on wheels, and can be emptied at either a dump station or in a public toilet. Composting toilets are the final common toilet type found in RVs. Composting toilets are a \u201cdry\u201d toilet, where waste goes into a holding tank with a composting material and becomes compost. The compost mixture must be stirred occasionally, but composting toilets often need to be emptied less often. There are less common toilets in RVs, for example incineration toilets, but they are not currently prevalent.",

RV toilets today most commonly consist of a cassette toilet, tank-style toilet, or a composting toilet.\nCassette Toilets: These toilets function like self-contained toilets within the RV, but use a cassette that may be pulled out and emptied manually. Emptying a cassette toilet contents at public restrooms requires special bags only sold at RV supply stores; therefore, it's always a good idea to empty the holding tanks at campground dump stations for convenience.\nTank-Style Toilets: Often referred to as \u201cporcelain,\u201d these RV toilets resemble home toilets due to the similarity in shape and design.  They work mechanically very similar to home toilets as well. The most significant design consideration is ensuring they are properly installed to secure the toilet within the RV and support varying elevations, angles, and wind forces throughout campground stay",

Finally, some can have \u201cflushing\u201d toilets that connects into a regular water and sewer system, but typically needs a special converter for non-potable water input. Most new RVs in the last 15 years have flushable toilets.",
            "It really depends on the campsite because most RVs will have cassette toilets where human waste goes into a tank outside of the toilet and it is emptied at a dump station, and some RVs have what is referred to as \"V-flush\" which discharges into a holding tank under the RV. Most State and National parks, as well as many private campsites, are going \"All-In\" and requiring the \"V-flush\" toilets to be disposed of at a septic dump. Some seasoned RVers are converting their \"V-flush\" RVs to \"cassette\" to comply. The dump station at our home site, Elks Lodge #2176 in Elk Grove, CA, accepts both tank-types of human waste (there is a third known as \"pneumatic\" where compressed air gets rid of the waste but this is rare)",

Originally played by men of means and privilege, it gradually became more widely accepted over the course of time, until, as the saying goes, the sun did not dare to shine on a golf links unplayed upon by the whole of society.",
            "Golf was invented in 1457 by James II of Scotland. James 1 was looking for a new game to challenge his subjects who typically hunted and wrestled, and something to take his mind off of his troubles. Golf as we know it today may have originated in Scotland but it's popularity soon spread to the rest of the United Kingdom and eventually the world. There are early references to a chariot race inspired game in Rome that some connect to modern day golf but these accounts were few in number and have no contemporary proof of how exactly the players were able to \"scramble\" around the Roman circuits.\nThe next evolution in Golf as we know it came when King James IV of Scotland, James II's great grandson signed into law an act that stated that \"no Golfer may cross an unfenced water hazard more than three times\". In 1764 James' great great grandson, King Charles set the first documented minimum height for golf holes at one-five - then in 1833 that was reduced by his great nephew, King William to ground level and since King Edward VII reduced it even further to two-fifty in 1919",
            "The first written mention of a golf game was in 1457 AD.  The game was played in Scotland.  Since that time, many variations of the game were experimented.  Golf as we know it today has only had an organized standard set of rules since 1897.  This new standardized golf game spread like wildfire, gaining a large following especially in the United Kingdom, US, Australia, India and now a total of 246 other nations around the world."

It has a simple structure where a rhyming word or phrase is used in substitution of the word's true meaning. Examples:\n\nApples and pears = stairs\nAdam and Eve = believe\nBarnaby Rudge = judge\nBees and Honey = money\nDog and Bone = Phone\nHank Marvin = starving\nLady Godiva = fiver",

            "Cockney rhyming slang is a slang language that was primarily used by East Londoners (also called Cockneys). The idea of the language is that words are replaced by other words that rhyme with them, e.g. instead of saying \u201cI\u2019m going to the shop,\u201d a Cockney might say, \u201cI\u2019m off up the apple and pears to buy me a fare.\u201d Fare is a Cockney term for money, hence the apple and pears rhyming with dollars. These sayings usually make a very basic sentence much longer and less sense so as to keep anyone but an East-Londoner confused about their intended meaning! In truth, it\u2019s really difficult to explain this style of slang well in writing. Here are a few examples:\nThe chaps were playing cards: The flat-caps were playing cards.\nFlat-caps are a traditional form of dress hat most usually associated with Northern England but more commonly seen on East Londoners who source them from the market.\nThe birds were at the gull; The girls were at the pub.\nThough there are many varieties of bird known for stealing fish from the Gull\u2019s",
            "Cockney rhyming slang is a form of slang that originated with the East End of London's Romani community. Words are replaced by words that rhyme with it, either partially or entirely. It's usually funnier when used in a long sentence so that the last word is not expected to rhyme, for example, \"Tesco's on tonight, innit. It's the old clinking up nose tonight. Let's get this peg-in-it-hole!\"\n\nTesco's is grocery shopping (as Tesco's is a well-known brand) - innit is a form of contracted 'isn't it', the clinking up nose is a reference to an old London criminal nickname for a pick-pocket 'the Clone'); the peg-in-it-hole is a reference to needle and a record. As 'ole is already rhyming with 'nose', this final phrase doesn't rhyme exactly - Cockney rhyming slang is all about unexpected rhymes.",
            "Cockney rhyming slang is a slang language that emerged in the East End of London, and is predominantly used by the old established orthochristian working class of Greater London. Most phrases use a series of replacement words (usually a noun) that rhyme with another series of words that also usually rhyme. Examples of Cockney rhyming slang include \"Fanny up the apples, Fogarty's gone down his pants.\" \"We only live once, mate. If only I had a brain cell then we'd have a better time.\" Or \"Happy birthday to the queen. They took us to the Toby last week.\" Words can also appear to rhyme at first glance (example \"steady\" / \"Ready\", \"papers\" / \"faders\") but often don't, particularly when you try to repeat the rhyme out loud. Another factor of Cockney Rhyming Slang which can make it challenging to decipher its meaning is when two or more words rhyme within a short sentence that appears to have a single meaning. This can also lead to phrases where a sentence is repeated back which"

These changes create conflicts between a teenager's inner desire for independence and the established bonds with family and society's expectations. As a result, teenagers disappoint their parents more than any other age group and in more than one ways:\n\nTeens disappoint their parents by lying to cover up their activities that go against parental expectations. For example, some teens who know their parents do not approve of alcohol consumption still lie about going out with friends, who in reality are also drunk.  \n\nTeens disappoint their parents by disregarding parental advice. For example, parents who keep telling their teenage kids to focus on their school work still find that their kids engage in distractions and waste time on social media instead.",

This can lead to typical behavior such as arguing with the parents, making decisions without asking or seeking approval, flunking a few grades in school, etc. As difficult as it may be for the parents, this process must be gone through. Only a generation later can a son or daughter tell their parents how they should act, how they should make decisions, which school is good enough, etc. There is no other way than through disappointing and worrisome behavior, even if only for a season, in order to lay the foundations for this independence. Only those who have disappointed their parents can protect and care for their own children in the future in a sufficiently independent and capable manner. Because at some point even the moms and dads have to give their children the space to assert their independence. This is a big topic in parenting and family science and is still the subject of extensive discussions among pediatricians, family physicians, and parents.",

Factors such as number of championships won, individual accolades, career statistics, longevity, and the level to which a player's level of play dominated over their contemporaries are common criteria for determining who is the greatest NBA player of all time. However, this question is complicated by others who state that comparing players across different generations is not possible, and thus the debate should be focused on who is the greatest player within a given generation.\n\nThe NBA.com website states that \"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time\". Jordan's perfect record in the finals, dominance over contemporaries (many of whom did not win any championships during the years Jordan was active), and holding the highest career regular season scoring average are often used to justify his status as the greatest NBA player of all time.

It was originally made of two curved planks and a crossbar, with only the front two legs on the ground, giving it its characteristic rocking motion. It is popular at older ages, because people don't sit as far to the back and need something wider at the ends in front of them."

Generally people are more polite and considerate. A small town will often have smaller local businesses as well; supporting the local business owner is as simple as going for coffee at their shop, dining at one of their restaurants, or grabbing a quick ice cream from their ice cream shop because that is where locals go to buy supplies.",

There are fewer crime and less fear associated with larger cities. Small town economies are often closely tied to the agricultural industry. The nearby farm may even provide work for town residents, making unemployment rare. Oftentimes the people are more friendlier as well as older residents will remain, thus fostering more a family like atmosphere. It is very easy to get to know all of your neighbors in a small town.

If you are in the way of a pyroclastic flow there is no escape and your life is in immense danger because of their temperature and mobility.  It is best to stay away from active volcanoes that could have a chance of developing a pyroclastic flow.  Pyroclastic flows have also been known to travel as far as 30 kilometers from the volcano.",

            "A pyroclastic flow is formed by the rapid ejection of hot, fragmented lava and gases generated by a volcanic eruption. These type of eruptions usually occur in volcanically active regions or around a dormant volcano. Pyroclastic flows travels 5 - 65 km/h on average or 3 - 40 mph; but have been known to travel at speeds of 125 km/h or 77 mph, making them extremely dangerous because they are able to overtake people from the volcano regardless of the geography of the area. Because they carry extremely hot temperatures and spewing rocks and gases, the Pyroclastic flow becomes able to ignite fires far away from the original volcanic area. This has been known to cause burn injuries as well as to extinguish flora in areas where this type of ash is deposited; even for days later.",

An eruption begins as typical when magma from beneath the volcano's summit comes into contact with the atmosphere and heats up, turning into steam. The blast of steam can erode the sides of the volcano and shoot out chunks of debris in all directions. The debris mixes with new volcanic ash, and because it is extremely hot it continues to erode everything around it. Because there is so much debris and it is traveling at high speed, a pyroclastic flow can cut through solid concrete and level entire cities.",

Unlike basketball, which originally used a round basketball, netball employs an octagonal-shaped ball which is smaller and lighter.

While it's hard to determine a specific reason why fans love the band, many fans cite frontman (and one time Kentucky Derby winner) Eddie Vedder as a key aspect of their appeal. Fans also rave about the band's ability to blend multiple musical genres into one unique sound that varies show to show.  While the band hasn't put out any new original material in over 5 years, many fans will point to their live sets in concert halls and stadiums as the real treasure.   As with most bands, if you hear just one song by the band 'My Morning Jacket,' it could very well be one of their most well-known hits (Zoo Animals, The High Road, Only Six Feet Down) as that might be the only song the casual listener is familiar with.",
            "People like the band My Morning Jacket for a variety of reasons.  The lead vocalist has an unique and emotive singing style which appeals to a broad group of music lovers.  Fans like the band for live performance reasons because they put on a unique event while also providing solid guitar rifts and a powerful drum beat with deep bass that penetrates the pits of your chest.  Most concerts have something extraordinary that happens like guitar rig exploding into a huge flame, drummers jumping in to drums from cables 60 feet in the air etc...  Another reason is that almost all of their songs are pretty long; like entering a different world which can ebb and flow like life; building and crashing; mellow and loud.   Lastly, the lead singers voice goes into crazy falsettos that soar with range like an angel and power like a soul singer! He can hit notes only dogs can hear; like a canine symphony! One could surmise this was a factor on why Jim James of this band sang with Johnny Cash on his final albums as well as playing on-stage with bands like The Flaming Lip & Queens of the Stone Age.",

Many fans like the band simply for their raw energy and live performances, however, their studio albums are also excellent for a casual listener seeking chill jam sessions. Some may classify the music too simply as rock, as that categorization tends to come with a lot of stereotypes that many musicians don't fit into. \nUltimately, the appeal and wide fanbase comes from the broad strokes that make up the band's genesis - it started with two friends jamming around high school in a small town in Kentucky, to a full band now comprised of multiple musicians who bring fresh takes into the studio, on stage, and to their recorded albums."

Some say that System Thinking has an \"anti-intellectual\" streak, as it challenges people not to make the errors of reification, reductionism, essentialism, and normalisation (see is-arelativity).",
            "Systems thinking in management is an approach that looks at the overall system instead of breaking it down in parts. Systems thinking focuses on interdependencies between parts of a system, rather than treating each part in isolation.\n\nThe goal of system thinking in management is not to find simple solutions, but rather an understanding of complex problems and how different factors are interrelated.\n\nAn important concept in systems thinking is the term \u2018feedback\u2019. Feedback means returning input to an effect. In a system, there can be inputs, throughputs and outputs, but also there can be different types of outputs (like delayed or probabilistic) or non-typical outputs (like errors or failures). \n\nAnother important concept is the term \u2018loops\u2019. Loops are the connection between inputs and outputs. Depending on the system, different types of loops can be distinguished; from negative feedback loops to positive feedback loops or even no feedback loops. All loops cause interdependent changes that, as the complexity of the system increases, can lead to emergent behaviors. This means that we can anticipate certain results from managing and adjusting the components of the system, but we can\u2019t fully predict the emergent behavior of a",
            "System Thinking was first introduced by Ludwig van Bertalanffy in 1945 and since then it has emerged as an independent discipline and an interdisciplinary approach to the understanding of complex systems in various domains such as physics, biology, sociology, psychology etc. The general idea of systems thinking is to look at the complex phenomena from a perspective that is holistic and emergent . \nAn holistic view signifies looking at the entire system and its interactions rather than studying the parts in isolation. Emergence is the phenomenon where qualities and behaviours of complex systems cannot be predicted by studying its constituent parts in isolation.",
            "In organizational management and leadership, systems thinking or systems dynamics is a style of understanding and managing complexity that was founded by Peter M.\n\nLawrence, in Boston, Massachusetts in the 1940s and 1950s and popularized by Jay Forrester at MIT beginning in 1956.\n\nThe method takes its name from its focus on systems rather than individual components or elements. Systems thinking approaches situations in a holistic manner, considering how a system's constituents interact and affect one another within the system as a whole. The term thinking in terms of systems was coined by Anatol Loewe in 1957.\n\nSystems thinking is composed of two key aspects: stocks and flows. A system can be represented graphically by displaying the stocks (the levels) and flows (the rates or patterns) between them. For example, Forrester diagrammed the system of interest rates, money supply and governmental deficits in his 1961 book Industrial Production and Inflation; it was recreated and modified for teaching and study in subsequent editions.\n\nThose stocks and flows are often arranged in a feedback loop"

            "Many scientists will tell you that trust is what underpins all our interpersonal relationships. They argue that if two parties cannot trust each other there can never truly be any lasting relationship. This is a pragmatic point of view as it is hard to imagine a relationship being sustained over time where either of the parties in question does not place trust in the other. Whether it is a personal or professional relationship trust will often underpin our judgements about just how serious we are in any relationship with another party. Scientists define trust as a form of confidence where one party in a relationship places reliance on the other to do what is expected. Without trust in a relationship, that relationship rarely ever gets off the ground let alone achieves any degree of lasting success.",

By sharing your passion and the value you bring and finding other people that can appreciate and share in your excitement, you'll find people that resonate with you.

The first element is trust: both individuals need to be able to trust one another.  A strong foundation of trust creates a space where both parties feel secure in expressing themselves honestly without fear of judgment. The second element, and this is closely linked to the first, is genuine communication: open, frequent, and honest communication is essential for an open relationship. This involves actively listening and actually hearing what the other person is saying as opposed to just preparing your own response. The third and final element is honesty: being completely honest with yourself and the other person helps you build trust and establish a genuine connection. In order to build a healthy relationship that is based on trust, frequent open communication and true honesty are key. If you keep these fundamentals in mind you will be set up for success.",

Down insulation is not as common because it will not work as well when wet versus synthetic insulation that is intended to hold more of its insulation value while it gets wet.

Stream processing frameworks can perform many different types of processing on streaming data. The specific type of processing depends on the nature of the data, the requirements of the organization attempting to process the data, and the type of database or other system with which the stream-processing framework will integrate. A stream-processing system must also handle missed or late data in a stream, as different sources will generate or receive data at different rates, and some sources (e.g. a log file) may emit data in bursts or with some degree of random spacing. As an example, a message queue may publish messages at a relatively slow rate and a database may insert messages at a relatively fast rate, so it is very important that a stream-processing system be able to ingest large amounts of data at high rate"

People who vote for gun laws have not had someone in their family shot or impacted. We don't want a personal event or death of a closed one to create a new law. An eye for an eye doesn't bring lives back. Educate the masses. Also, women tend to vote more positive on banning rifles as compared to men. Get more women out to change the law.\n\n2.  There is license for fishing and hunting. Guns should be rented and not owned. If you're into recreational things make it possible to rent guns and not own.  Do background check, and let the person enjoy his time with the toys but cannot own it. This would allow the manufacture and NRA in business. \n\n3. Never sell assault rifles to general public.

Gun ownership is not the issue as that is also a fundamental right, but the death and innocent lives hurt because someone with wrong intent was able to access a weapon to cause death is inexcusable, especially when there are more responsible and sane ways to resolve issues",

Gun control is an ongoing national dialogue that remains prevalent mainly due to high volume of Gun Violence prevalent in modern day America. The NRA's stance as an anti-gun control lobby has contributed to increased rates of Gun Violence as well as several mass shootings that has raised concerns among the public at large with respect to how gun laws are governed and policed in America. Efforts to re-regulate existing gun laws and implement stricter gun control measures has resulted in increased tensions on both sides of the aisle.

Other countries, including allies, allow stricter gun laws when encountering mass shootings. Why should I buy a gun made for war if all I'm reading about in the US is good and law abiding citizen with automatic weapons killing and maiming innocent people? The NRA is a special interest group only looking out for their own pockets; it's not about protecting our communities and children any longer. We have children lives to protect; we can't allow ourselves to be bought by our pockets to allow automatic weapons into civilian life because of an outdated constitution amendment that really has no right to exist on it's own at this day and age.",

The current issue with gun control that has been festering is the availability of highly dangerous, high power guns in easily accessible semi-automatics. As one pulls the trigger they have multiple \"shots\" due to lack of manual recourse to remove this lever. The previous generation, that had to \"recycle\" their rounds from individual pumps as it were, has long removed themselves from voting populations due to natural death and such this hasn't been much of a concern. This however has meant there hasn't been substantial reform. As the current political leanings go, most presidents want tougher policies on guns to remove NRA strongarm/lobbying from their platforms, they will not take a stance against such unless their base back home is at minimum a constituency worth mentioning."

For a reflector telescope, the light entering the telescope bounces off a concave mirror that is curved inward, and the image is produced at the focus of the telescope. A refractor telescope uses 2 lenses to form the image, 1 concave and one convex. The refractor optics require a longer and more rigid telescope to form the image at the focus, which makes a refractor telescope generally shorter in length. The bigger weakness of a reflector telescope is that it suffers from the effects of chromatic aberration caused by the different refractive indices of the different light spectrums, especially blue and red. The stronger, brighter images cause ghost or halos in the view of the scope.",
            "A reflector telescope, like the popularOrion xBright 130ST refractor, uses mirrors to collect and focus light and form an image of the night sky. A refractor telescope, like the Meade LightBridge 127 telescope, collects light using a lens. The advantages of a refractor telescope are better detail resolution and that it collects the light using a shorter focal length which produces less coma.  Both are popular telescope types and choosing between the two should come down to budget and detail resolution preferences.",
            "Refractor telescopes gather light using a lens, whereas reflector telescopes use a mirror to gather light and produce the image. Reflector telescopes can be made larger and gather more light for an observable area, thus giving more detail and making it easier to view more distant objects. Refractor telescopes tend to be sharper and free of chromatic aberrations. \n\nThe advantage or disadvantage of a refractor telescope in contrast to a reflector telescope depends on what is valued more highly by the astronomer.",

The most notable positive effect would be reduced environmental impact: although dirigibles, like airplanes, need engines, dirigibles are filled with lighter-than-air gas and therefore no power is needed to counteract gravity, so they consume less fuel. However, there would be a significant negative economic impact because dirigibles fly much more slowly than airplanes, thus the items airplanes carry (e.g. people and freight) would take much longer to get to their destination. In addition, another problem with dirigibles is that they are less able to handle strong winds compared to airplanes, so it might be necessary for the dirigible to take a more circuitous route than an airplane, or simply delay the flight until the bad weather passes.",
        "output": [
            "Pros: Dirigibles can cruise more slowly than airplanes.\ndirigibles might use lighter-than-air gases (cheaper and more available than jet fuel)\nthe envelopes of dirigibles would add protection against anti-aircraft weaponry\nmore comfortable, less jet lag\nCons: dirigibles are much slower than airplanes\nonly one Dirigible in the sky at a time for a specific route (lower reliability)\n Dirigible crashes probably deadly to passengers and crew\nadditional safety features for dirigible passage",

Cons:They are extremely less fast than airplanes -up to 8 times less fast- and require flammable fillings which pose safety hazards if the gas is not properly maintained. They also have less of a margin for error - one strong gust of wind can ruin your day when in adirgible.",
            "The replacement of civilian airplanes with dirigibles would come with both advantages and disadvantages. For air travel in areas without mountains or steep inclines, dirigibles may be able to save time as they are not constrained by the need to ascend into thinner air as do airplanes and because the lifting force from airfilled bags of lighter than air gas provides the only necessary thrust for the craft. Additionally, since dirigibles have no visible means of propulsion as do airplanes, the aesthetic value could also become a popular selling point. Because they need to transport a means of propulsion (ie. engines or gas) the durability difference when comparing the mass of dirigibles to that of the same number of airplanes would probably be significant in a dirigible's favour as well. However, since there are large swathes of populated land in which flying is not possible at all due to being in an area surrounded by mountains on all sides, there is probably some segment of the market to be had if dirigibles could somehow bypass this issue.",

            "Tom Brady or Peyton Manning.  \n\nIf we look purely at passing metrics such as completion percentage, passer rating and the number of seasons achieving a 5,000-yard passing season then Drew Brees is widely considered the all-time greatest quarterback.\n\nLooking across multiple sports analyst' rankings of quarterbacks you will find different answers.  \n\nIf we look at the recent history of NFL quarterbacks from 2000 on the all-time greatest quarterback conversations usually starts with Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and Aaron Rodgers all within seconds of each other.  \n\nYou could include other great quarterbacks in that conversation as well such as Joe Montana and Walter Payton from an earlier time.",
            "While opinions on who is the greatest NFL quarterback of all-time vary, almost everyone would agree Tom Brady should be in that conversation. It took Tom Brady twenty years, 7268 passing attempts, and leading five different teams to the Super Bowl to finally lose his first, before he has 7 Super Bowl victories, 3 MVP awards and is the NFL's all-time leader in passing yards and touchdowns. To this point, it is unknown if he can match or exceed these accomplishments. Despite these incredible accolades there are still those who say Brady does not belong in this conversation due to suspicions of tampering in the inflation of the footballs prior to the AFC Championship game in 2015 which he was accused of orchestrating by the New England Patriots organization. It should be noted though, no other quarterback has ever come close to the accolades Brady has achieved without similar negative controversy.",

Those 4 criteria include Super Bowl wins, completion percentage, passer rating, and number of career win as a starting quarterback.  Based on those 4 criteria, Tom Brady is widely considered to be the greatest NFL quarterback of all-time",
            "When it comes to the topic of the greatest NFL quarterback of all-time, there are many factors that fans, pundits, media and even players themselves weigh in their respective rankings of this great debate. Different eras bring up questions in different regards such as comparing apples to oranges. You want to compare NFL great Bill Russell's career to Lebron James'? Okay, that debate can have merit despite one being the NBA great and the other in the NFL. But there is no comparing Bo Jackson to LaDainian Tomlinson because they played in different time and LT faced defenses during his era in the NFL which weren't the same as in Bo's era. This leaves us to evaluate just QBs.\nQuarterbacks can evaluate based off the number of championships. This is fair given they are on the helm of their team when it really matters at the end of the season with the hardware on the line. To go all-in on having the largest sample size in terms of Super Bowl appearances one might look to Joe Montana as this is the best criteria to evaluate. The sample size he's given makes Joe Montana the greatest NFL QB of all time"

        "output": [
            "Lions and tigers are both members of the Felidae family, which means that they share some physical and behavioral characteristics. However, there are many ways in which these two species are distinct. \n\nLions and tigers do not mate with each other as they form different species, so do not produce hybrid offspring. Tigers also have distinct markings which differ from lions. Unlike lions who are largely social animals and live in pride, tiger population numbers are much lower because they are largely solitary animals. It is also more dangerous to be attacked by a pack of lions than a single tiger!",
            "Lions and Tigers belong to the same family of animals called Felidae. Both of them have several similar physical characteristics.  Some of the notable similarities are: Both are carnivores, have cushion-like pads on their toes and strong flexible jaws, can see in both colours of the visual spectrum and can reach speeds as fast as thirty miles an hour. On the other hand, there are some significant differences as well such as: Lions are social animals and can reside and hunt in groups called prides, whereas Tigers are solitary animals and generally hunt alone",
            "Genetically, lions and tigers are quite similar. They belong to the same family of animals, called Pantheridae. The main difference is that lions are part of the species panthera leo, whereas tigers are panthera tigris. From anecdotal observations one could say that lions tend to have long manes, which give them the appearance of having a \"wilder\" look. However, both species look fearsome and it's a misconception that because lions have shorter legs and a relatively bigger body they cannot run as fast as tigers. In fact, both have an almost similar top-speed when running. The one area where tigers could possibly have an edge is that their body proportions allow them to cover longer strides, given their longer legs. In the end, it is a tricky question though and most experts admit that even in the natural habitat it's hard to spot differences while watching both predators hunt in action.",

Other genres may place different demands - such as jazz where it is necessary to play melodic lines with sufficient volume to stand out above the rhythm section, whilst simultaneously being able to drop unobtrusively out of the way when another player is taking a solo. In jazz different techniques have been developed to assist in this endeavour; the use of arpeggios, slapping and 'chord melody'.

Golf was the first sport to embrace the value of par to 18 holes; in other words, par is the expected total score for 18 holes based on the rating of the course with the rating taking in to account factors like elevation changes, landscape features, obstacles and so on.\nSo, the aim of Golf is to score one under the par. For e.g if the rating for a particular hole is 4 and you make the shot in 3 strokes, you score a birdie 1. Similarly, if the rating is 3 and you score it in 2 strokes you score a Eagle.",

If you're an extremely skilled golfer, and you manage a birdie on every hole, you'll finish the round 27 under par!

This study was published in 1730, the first major published work in a European language questioning the then recently accepted medical opinion regarding coffee being a healthy addition to the daily routine.\n\nBochat attended the University of Basel, first to study theology as was expected for young men of his generation in Basle, but eventually graduated as Doctor medicinae, both cum laude, on the advice of Hiob Ludwig Roth, who recognized his obvious talents and would eventually help Bochart in obtaining a post as a professor at the same University.\n\nWhile Bochart's treatise might be dismissed today for its lack of modern, empirical observation, at the time it was a courageous attack on the medical consensus which regarded coffee as a harmless addition, in large quantities, to the daily routine. It may be noted that Bochart published this paper during his studies at Basle, indicating that it represented a published doctoral thesis and clearly shows that",

        "label": "The bikepacking movement became popular in the 2010s. Compared to traditional bike touring, which has been popular for decades, bikepackers typically carry less and lighter equipment. The lighter load makes it easier to ride off-road. However, the equipment, such as frame bags, is often more expensive than traditional panniers. Furthermore, the limited storage space of bikepacking setups promotes an even more minimalistic lifestyle.",
        "output": [
            "In bikepacking, the cyclist tends to be more minimalist with regard to carrying gear in favor of carrying less weight but generally more expensive high tech equipment; where the bikepacker typically carries a sleeping bag, clothing, tent, stove, and food with the goal of traversing self contained across difficult wilderness terrain, the tourist is more focused on sight seeing and typically will take more time as they will visit towns or hotels regularly; in this regard bike tours tend to follow more established roads and will have the option of vehicle support",
            "Bikepacking gained popularity in the last decade, however, the combination of using a bicycle as a means to travel, to carry with you only what is essential, and often camping along the way is no new invention. \nHowever, with the surge of interest towards bikepacking comes a fair amount of confusion as to the differences between this type of travel and other modes like long distance bicycle touring, bike adventure racing or lightweight bicycle touring.\nAt its core, bikepacking has much in common with all the forms of transportational cycling; all share similarities like carrying a tent, stove, food supplies and camping etc, often in a \"frame-supported\" capacity meaning that the setup is carried on bicycle frames such as handle bars, seat posts and occasionally even using dedicated trailers (not to be confused with a tricyle/recumbent bicycle!). \nThe key differences come when diving into the levels of packing efficiency, minimalism and speed that bikepackers generally are seeking when venturing on such adventures.\nIn general, touring cyclists carry more, weigh a bit more on",
            "While the bike tourer carries less stuff than the bike packer, the spirit remains the same: ride a bike and take less stuff. You can take a support vehicle with all your stuff, but that defeats the idea. The bike packer tries to get as light as possible on the bike itself, and possibly carry some minimal stuff like lights, air filter, multi tool, tire patch and first-aid.  Bike tourers typically carries heavier loads (though not always). Often, these luggage would consist of clothes, books and electronic gadgets which are important for \"comfort\" and to fill one's need. One interesting aspect about bike packing is this stripped-down form becomes efficient as a carry modality: while you might carry 10 or 20 Kg of load depending on the bikepacking rig and duration of trip for your longest touring bikes, a bikepacking load might just be 6 - 9 Kg as we would carry less water, clothe, fuel cans etc. The efficiency here would help cover larger distances and have more time \"at play\" each day. Of late there is a strong",
            "Bikepacking, which is a portmanteau of bicycle and packing, refers more so to the carrying of frame bags and wearing clipless pedals. Bicycle touring is a broader term encompassing this style but also includes long distance travel, generally on paved roads, with luggage carried on or attached to the bicycle by any means, be they panniers, duffel bags, racks, or even a hodgepodge creation of tubes and cables."

            "Based on recording functionality. Gorpro and osmo both can do high high high quality day time filming easily but there is a huge difference when light starts fading. Osmo wins in low light by a mile and that is huge. I have used gorpro 5 times since I bought it since it has arrived. In those 5 times, the light was not in my favor in 2 times and it managed to give decent result as long as light was involved. But in 3 occasions when light started fading it gave up way too fast and could have used more time to adjust the light. It will always say no to me when I tell it to use more light and keep filming longer which is the major letdown since you want it to last a little longer in fading light. DJI on the other hand manages to get it right no matter the lighting condition if you don't mind a tiny bit of shake or some cropping in super dark corners. And with it being so much more powerful, it can still get rid of those distracting noises and give you much cleaner file no matter what light. That for me is game changing and I wish gorpro could match that one day."

A young child can yank on their tails or fur, and parents don\u2019t need to be concerned that their child will get bitten (although the golden doodle will likely nudge the child to stop that behavior).  \n\nThey also are generally intelligent dogs, and learn easily.  More importantly, they are easy to house train, which is important for a family with young children, since there aren\u2019t additional messes to clean up after. They don\u2019t shed like long-haired dogs, where the hairs can get on your clothes.  They shed in clumps of hair, which are easier to see and clean up. \n\nLast, golden doodles are very cute dogs, which is another element that has contributed to their popularity. \n\nHowever, because they are part poodle, they can be excitable, in particular when they are puppies, and they need to get a lot of exercise so that they can expend their energy. As a result, they should be with an active family so that they can get plenty of activity.",

As long as the golden doodle goes into homes with kids at a young age that understand how to play and interact with the golden doodle, you should be just fine. I would just do an additional refresher course when we introduce the new dog to the household just to reinforce play styles and proper manners for all.",
            "There isn't a breed of dog that is absolutely a good fit for every family or family dynamic. The temperament, size, energy level, etc of a dog need to fit with the needs, ages, sizes, personalities, etc of the owners. The golden doodle, when raised well is loving, friendly and intelligent. That said, like all breeds, they have their own special challenges as well. As a large breed or a 'med' - sized breed, golden doodles have a tendency to develop joint issues as they mature and may need extra care or avoid high impact activities. There are many 'designer breeds' like golden doodles (poodle - lab etc) which can vary in cost vs the 'real deal' retriever (golden, yellow, etc) mix. These 'designer breeds', are often mixed breed dogs, which may or may not have all the temperaments or challenges of the Poodle, Lab etc breed depending on whose puppy they may resemble more. Poodle dogs are known for their curls and being very smart and 'easy to train'. Labs, while loving",
            "It depends on who you ask, but in our household, a golden doodle is a great pet for families with young children. As you likely know, golden doodles are a breed that results from crossing a golden retriever with a poodle.  We decided to buy one for our family as we believed they shared many of the characteristics that our family loved in a dog - smarts, affection, easy trainability - but, we were a little leery they may exhibit some of the typical, overly energetic traits of puppies that could be too much for our two boys, both under 5.  Our pup has exceeded all of our hopes!  We call her our \"baby\" in the family because she can be a little rambunctious at times but, is incredibly smart and so loving!  I never expected I would look into a puppy's eyes and see my child's face staring back at me.  That doesn't mean I didn't prepare our little one(s) for the new addition.

The poodle has a long, curly, and hypoallergenic coat and the labradors are both loving and friendly which they can also pass down to their doodles.  Since doodles are so intelligent and loving, they usually don't require too much time and effort training than other breeds. However, be ready for lots of love from this breed and a huge desire for cuddles since it's one of the characteristics the labs passed down to them. As this breed's popularity grew, be careful about the breeding standards, some \"backyard breeders\" are just taking normal labradors and Poodles and mating them randomly resulting in some health issues down the road in newer generations. Try to seek the health guarantee as well as a breeder who emphasizes temperament and character trait, that ensures you raise a super well tempered and super doodle!"

As an example lets says your are planning to sell after 5 years in the market and interest rates are very cheap, lets assume you can afford to do the above said repairs and also account for the market downfall, You still may loose about 10-15% of the equity due to how the house prices react during the downturn.

Prices generally begin going up in June and hit its peak in August and Sepember.The market then starts a downward trajectory throughout the rest of the 12 months and reaches bottom in around October time frame. However the rates of the change varies by areas and depends on if there are any external factors like global pandemic to influence the trend, which has shown significant variations in recent times.It\u2019s good to buy during early months because a lot of house listed in December stays there during following year and sellers usually give price drop to make sure the houses are sold.

Some folks tends to wait until the end of the year to take advantage of a new year tax advantages. All in all buying a house is a tough choice and one might need to consider various aspects like personal life expectations, near future plans , location specific impact on the job market and stability of local economy to name a few",
            "The US Housing Market is notoriously unpredictable in short windows of time. Home valuation change is driven by many factors. One widely discussed theory is the effects of an administration change, e.g. the presidential election. Interest Rates is another driver, when rates go up, down-payment required for mortgage is increased as well, making home ownership more difficult to obtain, and pushing down housing markets. Additionally, geographical location plays a major role. For example, some cities (San Francisco, San Diego) have very inflated housing market due to the proximity to SF bay area where tech giants are populating in US, drawing talent from all over US and oversea. The above theories indicate that, the shorter the windows you buy in, the unpredictability of when to step in might affect your investment negatively in long run.
